Intern Testimonials \"This semester, we've recieved a grant to help students who partent at KSU. We've provided resources in the Cobb County and surrounding areas in the five areas of support: social capital, early childhood education , post-secondary and employment pathways, economic assets, and health and well-being.\" I've been interning at the Children and Family Programs at KSU from August to December. During the past four months, we've been training and learning about behavioral modification (BMOD) treatment. The treatment is directed towards children with behavioral problems, like those with ADHD, in order to help produce a positive behavior. BMOD is a beneficial evidence-based treatment because it reduces children's problematic behavior, like noncompliance, while reducing the need for high doses of ADHD medication. Behavior is modified by setting rules and expectations, and modify antecedents, which are events that occur before a specific behavior. This semester, we've received a grant to help students who parent at KSU. We've provided resources in the Cobb County and surrounding areas in the five areas of support: social capital, early childhood education, post-secondary and employment pathways, economic assets, and health and wellbeing. We've also provided them time management and self-care tips. Each session, we give the parents behavioral modification training. The student parents are all so eager about learning new ways to get their children to comply and behave. The student parents are always ready to share their experiences and tips as parents. The pandemic has made us adapt to online learning and has affected us all. We're prepared for next semester and any changes that may happen. -Amanda Winkjer, Fall 2020 Undergraduate Intern \"I feel that my work at this agency has proved me to be a great Asset , resource, and advocate for student-parents at Kennesaw State University .\" During my time with the Children and Families Program (CFP), I was able to sit in on meetings with our community partners and community members. Through these avenues, we established relationships with other colleges, such as Georgia Northwest Technical College, who were also looking to create a Student-Parent Program, and were able to generate awareness of the services CFP offers amongst caretakers in Cobb County. These meetings have made me aware of the amount of time that must be dedicated to meetings with partners and stakeholders. However, this awareness gained through experience has only reaffirmed my interest in community collaboration as an aspect of my future career. We also worked with students who are parents during our six-week Student-Parent Program. We provided the parents with techniques \u2013 such as commands or planned ignoring \u2013 to assist them in managing their children\u2019s behavior and taught them how thoughts and feelings can influence behavior. It was encouraging to watch the parents develop greater understanding of the techniques and share their experiences implementing them. To assist the student-parents with other hardships they might face, we began to create a website toolkit containing five categories of resources: early childhood education, economic assets, physical health and wellbeing, postsecondary and employment programs, and social capital. Our efforts primarily focused on social capital and early childhood education; however, as these categories were what student-parents identified as their greatest needs. To me, this effort was wonderful because it was not only oriented toward those enrolled in the program but also comprehensive in its scope for when different needs might arise in the future. I am therefore sure that the student-parents will be grateful when they receive this toolkit. -Grace Bowe, Fall 2020 Undergraduate Intern \"I've developed an understanding of all three main tenants of social-emotional learning and the basics of behavor modification....it was so much fun participating in the student-parent sessions and getting to know some of them and their stories.\" These past few months as an intern for the Children and Family Programs at Kennesaw State University, I\u2019ve developed an understanding of all three main tenants of social-emotional learning and the basics of behavior modification. Before the program, I had little knowledge of behavior modification and the obstacles that student-parents go through daily. I had somewhat of an understanding that it was difficult, but wording it as difficult is not enough. In each session, parents were taught great methods that could help them have a better understanding of their child\u2019s emotions and set great relationships with them. The student-parent sessions where I got to understand their perspectives and learn more about parenting techniques along their side. It was so much fun participating in the student-parent sessions and getting to know some of them and their stories. Not only do I have this in mind for when I bear children, but I have it in mind for when I become an educator myself. I am always looking for future ideas and experiences that I can integrate into my future career, that is why I am so fortunate to be able to get the education from the program and learn so much. Although the spread of COVID has taken over the physical opportunities I could have gotten from experiencing this program in person, I still believe I got the best kind of training and comprehension of training. And there have been some ideas for the upcoming semester that I will be a part of. I was fortunate to sit in every meeting and get to know the wonderful, kind team. I also have participated in some grant meetings and writings. I am looking into continuing to gain more experience from such a helpful team. -Julissa Tello, Fall 2020 Undergraduate Intern \"As a non-traditional student who is also a parent of college aged children i especially enjoyed my experience working with the Student Parents Ambassador program.\" I have learned so much over the past four months. I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to intern with Children and Family Programs. As a nontraditional student who is also a parent of college-aged children, I have especially enjoyed my experience working with the Student-Parent Ambassador program. I had attempted finishing my degree when my children were in elementary school, but decided to put it off once again as their activities became more of a priority than my own. If a support group for student parents was available at that time, I might have been more inclined to stick it out. Working with the student parents in the program was a beneficial way to see areas in which KSU could better meet the needs of its students. There is a great need for a childcare center on campus. If KSU were able to provide childcare then it would meet the needs of the student parents as well as provide an employment opportunity for the students who could potentially staff it. I also benefited from the behavior modification techniques and time management skills that Children and Family Programs provides to its student parents. -Melissa Hooper, Fall 2020 Undergraduate Intern \"It made me realize how many student-parents are missing out on benificial information for them as parents and students, and the importance of having a Program like this .\" Overall, this program has been of great value to me personally and education wise. From this program, I gained a great amount of knowledge from the internship and sessions. One of the most impactful things I realized is how beneficial the resources and tools given at the Children and Family (CFP) program is to student-parents, and how crucial it is for them to have them. {CFP is} a program I never knew existed at Kennesaw State University (KSU) until I came across it from my internship advisor. They have valuable information for student-parents, but it's unfortunate many schools don\u2019t have a program like this one. This was of my importance to me, because often we see institutions/ universities don\u2019t have any resources or tools for their student-parents; they see them as just students. It made me realize how many student-parents are missing out on beneficial information for them as parents and students, and the importance of having a program like this. This program provides amplitude of resources and tools to help individuals succeed academically and as parents. Furthermore, I found these sessions helpful for the student-parents and myself. Each session was broken down and focused on one topic at time. I found creating a toolkit and resources for the student-parent of importance. Parents have all the information discussed in the sessions handy and can reference back to it as needed. -Midelvia Contreras, Fall 2020 Undergraduate Intern To learn more about the internship process, please call (470) 578-2233 or email Dr. Allison Garefino at agarefin@kennesaw.edu Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Current Students Online Only Students Faculty & Staff Parents & Family Alumni & Friends Community & Business Related Links Libraries Housing Financial Aid Degrees, Majors & Programs Registrar Job Opportunities Campus Security Global Education Diverse & Inclusive Excellence Sustainability Accessibility Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) \u00a9 2022 Kennesaw State University.

The awards were presented virtually this year during the annual Georgia Association of Teachers of Japanese meeting, which was sponsored by the Georgia Department of Education, the Japan-American Society of Georgia, and GATJ. Davis joined KSU in 2015 as a part-time instructor and in 2019 became full-time lecturer with the WLC department. She actively engages in developing programs such as a virtual exchange program in partnership with a university in Japan, as well as thoughtfully incorporating project-based learning into her courses.

She subsequently went to work with Georgia Public Broadcasting\u2019s distance learning program, Irasshai, where she plays a role in the program creation on the curriculum development team, as well as training part-time instructors.

(Jun 28, 2022) \u2014 Regina Bradley, Ph.D., won the Georgia Author of the Year award in the essay category for her work titled, Chronicling Stankonia: The Rise of the Hip-Hop South. The Georgia Writers Association\u2019s (GWA) Georgia Author of the Year Awards (GAYA) is the longest-running literary award in the Southeastern United States said KSU\u2019s associate chair of the Department of English, Dr. Ralph Wilson. \u201cThe Department of English is very proud and happy to hear of Dr. Regina N. Bradley's latest accomplishment as a winner of the 58th Georgia Author of the Year Awards in the Essay Category,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cShe is an extremely talented writer, and the recognition is well deserved.\u201d John Havard, chair of the English Department said, \u201cDr. Bradley is among the most notable scholars in the new southern studies, doing work that deftly defies boundaries between literary and popular culture.\u201d First presented in 1964, the awards celebrate \u201cthe best literature by Georgia writers.\u201d The Georgia Writers Association has managed the GAYA event since 1994. Held virtually in 2022, the event honored winners and finalists from 113 nominees in 14 categories. The awards presentation is available on YouTube and the GWA website in its entirety. \u201cAs an author with deep insight into Georgia culture, she is an ideal recipient for a Georgia Author of the Year Award. Dr. Bradley and her work represent some of the best the English Department has to offer: creativity, solid scholarship, and social and community engagement,\u201d Dr. Havard added. Literary judge Megan Volpert said of Bradley\u2019s essay, \u201cBradley is a defining voice of the new south\u2014an engrossing one that blends academic analytical chops with the personal narrative of lived experience as a Black woman who grew up after the civil rights movement. Her argument, that hip-hop culture since the Eighties represents concerns and methodologies of the next wave of contemporary southern Black identities, is clear and persuasive and without alternatives.\u201d She went on to say, \u201cChronicling Stankonia begins with a close philosophical reading of Outkast and ends with an exhortation to invigorate cultural studies through attention to the popular arts and letters made by Black southerners.\u201d Regina N.

(Aug 2, 2022) \u2014 Kennesaw State University (KSU) associate professor of Interdisciplinary Studies Sara Giordano, Ph.D., with their co-investigator Angela Willey, Ph.D., of the University of Massachusetts (Amherst), have launched a biology education research project funded by a nearly $600K National Science Foundation (NSF) grant shared between the two universities. The research, being conducted in three phases over three years, examines how basic biological sciences are taught at the college level, and the context in which that body of knowledge has been created. Phase I, already underway, includes evaluating the most widely used introductory college-level biology textbooks nationwide. With the support of a research assistant, they also contacted every college biology instructor in Georgia to identify the most widely used textbooks and examine syllabi, and will do the same in Massachusetts, to identify potential geographical or regional differences in teaching materials. Phase II will examine biology education material from outside traditional biology resources to include work from feminist, Black, disability, and queer studies scholars, and environmental, reproductive justice, and healing justice activists. Finally, Phase III will focus on developing, testing, and deploying open-source teaching modules that offer a holistic approach to biology education and the biological sciences. Giordano expects an important outcome of the research will be codifying the research methodology so it may be applied to other fields of study. Asked what inspired this research focus, they explained that as a graduate student of neuroscience on track for their Ph.D., they understood scientific study to be an objective endeavor where students \u201cjust go and learn the truth.\u201d However, working with intersex, disability, and reproductive justice activists, Giordano realized that scientific study is siloed and although neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field, they said \u201cit is still only interdisciplinary within the maths and sciences.\u201d According to Giordano, this limited scope of biology misses the knowledge activists and scholars outside proper Biology have contributed. Giordano added that exposure to \u201cfeminist studies and from Black studies, reproductive justice movements, environmental justice movements, all of these things outside of the academy made me a stronger scientist inside the academy.\u201d This expanded view led them beyond neuroscience to consider the ethics, history, and philosophy of scientific study more broadly and to apply that wider, holistic framework as scientific research creates new knowledge. The concerns and insights of women, people of color, queer and gender non-conforming people, and people with disabilities have traditionally been marginalized in scientific research. \u201cWhat we [could] imagine about ourselves for the last 100 years\u2026has been about what we understand the possibilities of our biologies to be. \u2026You hear people say, well, this is human nature. This is not human nature. The debates are about whether something is natural or unnatural, whether something\u2019s possible or not misses the point that all knowledge is constructed in a particular time and place. Biology has a specific history and the very ideas of natural/unnatural were coproduced through colonization and the development of capitalism,\u201d said Giordano. \u201cSo that means we do want to get voices that have been marginalized because we think that will change what truths we come up with.\u201d This research considers what knowledge about the biological counts as science and how that has shaped biology education. Giordano emphasized this research starts from a different perspective that is especially relevant today. This research begins by asking, \u201cwhat do we need and want to know about our bodies and environments? In this moment, I think it\u2019s particularly important [because] we\u2019re seeing huge issues and debates around the truth about science. I think giving folks skills and resources to adequately evaluate something like COVID-19 in a broader context is crucial. [For example,] no virus can be purely biological matter that exists outside of a historical, economic, and social context. Instead of looking at those as separate things, we add them together. It\u2019s about how we look at it holistically.\u201d One potential outcome that is of interest to NSF and other science institutions may be that approaching biology in this way could increase diversity in STEM by expanding the scope and breadth of biological science education. However, to Giordano and Willey, the larger goals have to do with redistributing epistemic authority and resources towards a more just world. They hope their work will be used by students inside and outside of traditional academic settings to gain more control over their lives. For example, feminist movements produced their own materials such as Our Bodies, Ourselves and the Black Panther Party deployed community sickle cell testing while challenging racist Biology studies about violence and race. \u201cSome of the most important work then is claiming space for \u2018alternative\u2019 knowledge and helping provide methodologies for others to truly participate in science,\u201d Giordano said. When the research concludes, Giordano and their co-PI, Angie Willey, expect to have created an open-source series of biology teaching modules that are accessible to educators and the public as a supplement to existing textbooks. Additionally, the methodology for developing these tools will be firmly established and applicable to other fields of study. Sara Giordano has spent more than a decade working in ethics, science education, and pedagogy after earning a Ph.D. in Neuroscience through the Graduate Division of Biological and Biomedical Sciences at Emory University. Through this work, Giordano developed models for interdisciplinary science education using critical science literacy in university classrooms, reported on these experiments in a range of journals from fields such as science education, feminist studies, and science studies. Giordano\u2019s training and experience ensure the research team is well positioned to produce results that will broaden interdisciplinary biology education in a major way by targeting basic biology education. Angie Willey, who earned her Ph.D. in Women\u2019s Studies from Emory University, has an expertise in queer feminist theory, settler colonial and postcolonial studies, and the history of gender, sexuality, and race in the biosciences. She has been actively developing curriculum that closes the gaps in biology and feminist and queer theory since 2013 and co-edited a book (Queer Feminist Science Studies: A Reader 2017), and double special issue of Catalyst: Feminist, Theory, Technoscience (Science Out of Feminist Theory Vols 1 & 2 2017), to bring the work of critical theorists engaged with science\u2019s abstract concepts and material objects into direct conversation. Giordano and Willey have collaborated for more than a decade on research and curriculum development.

(Jul 25, 2022) \u2014 The third time was the charm when choosing a major for Sociology graduate, Alaina Hoofnagle. After entering KSU as an undecided major, Alaina first explored English Education and Business Management before finding a major that she knew was perfect for her. Alaina claims that even as a child, she has always been interested in \u201cmaking a difference\u201d but it was her sociological training that solidified her decision to create positive social change. \u201cI\u2019ve always been social justice-oriented, very interested in marginalized groups and changing things and making a positive change. And so, I was like, \u201cYep, this is up my alley,\u201d explained Hoofnagle. During her time as a student at KSU, Hoofnagle held many titles, from an Honors College student to a teaching assistant to a research assistant. Her latest title comes with her most recent recognition as the 2022 Outstanding Scholar for Sociology at the All-College Awards. Making the most of her time at KSU, Hoofnagle worked with Dr. Evelina Sterling as a research assistant. The findings from Alaina\u2019s research suggested the addition of a COVID-19-centered curriculum to the self-management program, called \u201cHealthy Together.\u201d This NIH-funded research project allowed Alaina to explore her interests in medical sociology and create a difference in the African American community. She went on to present the findings of this research at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research and the Symposium of Student Scholars at KSU. After graduating in Spring 2022, Dr. Sterling offered Alaina a part-time position to continue her research at Kennesaw State. When asked about her plans after completing her research, Alaina emphasized her desire for a new career path that will allow her to continue to facilitate social change. \u201cI didn't discover medical sociology until very recently. I was seeking a high-impact career path that would enable me to create positive social change and then I discovered medical sociology.\u201d Alaina also recognized the misconception about getting a social sciences degree and highlighted the practical implications of switching her major. \u201cWhen people ask me what I major in, a lot of people think of psychology, and they asked me if I want to be a counselor. I think people just have that misunderstanding of what sociology is. However, when I started taking sociology classes, my perspective on the world changed. I've always been kind of socially conscious. But the sociological training that I got at KSU helps me to see the world through the sociological imagination, and I see almost everything with the sociological reason behind.\u201d Alaina says that she now has a very analytical approach to current events that she sees on the news daily. Overall, she believes that her undergraduate education and experience at KSU has made her a well-rounded person and citizen. \u201cRegardless of what you study, it shows that you were able to show up, have grit, complete what you're doing.\u201d Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Current Students Online Only Students Faculty & Staff Parents & Family Alumni & Friends Community & Business Related Links Libraries Housing Financial Aid Degrees, Majors & Programs Registrar Job Opportunities Campus Security Global Education Diverse & Inclusive Excellence Sustainability Accessibility Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) \u00a9 2022 Kennesaw State University.

KSU Journey Honors College offers one-on-one advising to our students with in-person and virtual (Microsoft Teams) options available. KSU Journey Honors College advisors can offer guidance related to Honors requirements; we do not replace your primary major advisor for tracking your academic advancement. Rather, Honors advisors work in collaboration with your major advisor by helping identify Honors Learning Experiences within your major that capitalize upon developing your skills, exploring your interests, and preparing for your future goals. Participation in Honors advising is mandatory to remain in good standing with the program. Honors students are required to meet with their Honors advisor at least once each semester to ensure they remain on track to complete all Honors requirements. Honors students are advised based on campus, college, and in some cases by major.

Schedule and attend an advising meeting/midterm conference with an Honors Program advisor in the fall and spring semesters of each year. Complete the Introduction to Honors requirement within their first two semesters enrolled in KSU Journey Honors College. GPA to Remain in Good Standing Eligible: 3.25 Probation: 3.0-3.24 Ineligible: Below 3.0 Policy on HLE Requirements Honors Students are required to stay active in the Honors College throughout their academic journey at KSU. To stay active students are required to take a minimum of one Honors Learning Experience (HLE) during the fall and spring semesters of each academic year for a total of two HLEs per academic year until graduation. HLEs are not required in the summer, but can be taken in order to catch up or bank an HLE. Students can take more than one HLE in a semester, however, only one HLE can be banked toward the minimum HLE requirement for that academic year. A student unable to meet this requirement will be placed on Probation for Non-Participation. Banked Courses Honors students can store one or more HLEs in the bank to use in a future term toward completion of an HLE requirement. Only one banked HLE can be used per academic year. Introduction to Honors Honors students must complete the Introduction to Honors requirement (HON 1000 or HON 1100) within the first two semesters of joining the University Honors Program. Students must obtain a grade of B or higher to continue in KSU Journey Honors College. *Please note that HON 1000 satisfies the Introduction to Honors requirement but does not count as an Honors Learning Experience. Honors Probation Students may be placed on Honors probation for academic reasons or non-participation. Academic Probation A student whose institutional GPA falls between 3.0-3.24 will be notified that they are on academic probation. Students on Honors academic probation may remain in the program as long as each successive semester's GPA is 3.25 or higher. Students on Honors academic probation do not lose early registration privileges. Probation for Non-Participation A student who does not complete at least one Honors Learning Experience (HLE) each semester and does not have one banked, will be notified that they are on probation for non participation. A student who does not schedule and attend an advising meeting/midterm conference with an Honors Program advisor for two consecutive semesters will be notified that they are on probation for non participation. A student on probation for non-participation will lose early registration privileges during the probationary semester. In order to regain good standing, students must complete an HLE in the probationary semester. Only one non-participation probationary semester is allowed in a single academic year. If a student does not make up the missing HLE within two semesters, they will be ineligible to continue in the Honors Program. Removal from Honors A student whose institutional GPA falls below a 3.0 will be dropped from the University Honors Program without a probationary period but may petition for readmission when the institutional GPA has reached the required minimum. Non-Academic Considerations If a student\u2019s academic performance is adversely affected by non-academic problems (illness, accident, etc.) after the Last Day to Withdraw [from classes] without Academic Penalty (see the KSU Schedule of Classes for each term), the student should contact his/her instructor to discuss the possibility of receiving an Incomplete, or if withdrawal is necessary, the student should contact the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and the Director of the University Honors Program regarding options for medical withdrawals from courses. Documented non-academic problems resulting from an emergency will be given consideration for extension of the Honors probationary period. Reinstatement Any student who has been removed from the Honors Program may petition for readmission after the requirements for readmission have been met. The Honors Reinstatement Request will include an explanation of circumstances and a list of Honors Learning Experiences the student plans to take each term before graduation in order to graduate with the Honors Designation(s) they are pursuing. Students who wish to be reinstated must have an institutional GPA of 3.25 or higher. Failure to comply with KSU codes of conduct can/will result in dismissal from Honors. Introduction to Honors Honors students who do not complete the Introduction to Honors requirement (HON 1000 or HON 1100) within the first two semesters of joining the University Honors Program will be dismissed. When Introduction to Honors is taken, students must obtain a grade of B or higher to continue in KSU Journey Honors College. *Please note that HON 1000 satisfies the Introduction to Honors requirement but does not count as an Honors Learning Experience. Please note that Honors students who do not enroll in classes at Kennesaw State University (KSU) for a full semester must reapply to KSU Journey Honors College when they return to KSU. PEGS Students Remaining in Good Standing In order to remain in good standing with the PEGS program, students must maintain a minimum 3.5 KSU institutional GPA, complete the ten-hour service requirement (per semester), and fulfill PEGS program requirements for academic achievement and leadership development. PEGS students with a GPA between 3.25 and 3.5 will be on PEGS probation, but in good standing with the University Honors Program. PEGS students with a GPA between 3.0 and 3.25 will be on probation with PEGS and the University Honors Program.

Contract forms are due within the first month of the semester in which the project is being completed. See below calendar for specific deadline(s). Research assistance, teaching assistance, and applied learning forms should be submitted at least three days before drop/add is over for the semester in which the HLE will be completed. *Some of the forms below require a signature which should be scanned and submitted to KSU Journey Honors College.

She has worked in the field of aging for nearly 40 years in both the hospital and academic setting as a geriatric nurse practitioner/educator and consultant. We sat down with Lois to learn more about gerontology \u2014 the study of aging. The emergence of gerontology: Gerontology is one of the fields that has emerged. Forty years ago, gerontology was seen as a secondary part of what social studies and healthcare were about. We know people were getting older, but no one looked at the data and saw the growth. In 1958, they began the Baltimore Longitudinal Studies. People began to look at how we were aging. The decades grew on, and we saw that people were living past 65. In 1935 when they implemented social security, the expectation was that you lived to be about 65/66 years of age. Now, people are living to be 70-80. Now in 2018, the fastest growing segment of our population is the 90-year-old. We have 72,000+ people who are over 100. We have health and medical science that has made it possible for people to live better. Not just age, but age with a quality of life. We have opportunities for people. The issues facing the aging population: People are beginning to understand it. We have more people going into the field of gerontology. We have more organizations for gerontology. On the negative side, we also have more silos where organizations and services want to serve older people, but they do not have the money and resources. We have so many good ideas and young people who see the value in the field of aging, but if they contain themselves in these small subsets, we are not going to have the growth that we need. The growth of gerontology It is a remarkable feeling. As a registered nurse in 1965, I was told that if you go into the field of geriatrics, it is because you don\u2019t qualify in the hospital setting. They said you\u2019d be better off going into aging because you don\u2019t need people with good experience, but today you can get a Ph.D. in Geriatrics. When I became a nurse practitioner, we had to have a master\u2019s degree. Now, they are hoping all nurse practitioners will have a doctorate. On the Gerontology Certificate program: I hope students learn about the aging process, the issues facing all that is and will be aging, and the humor of aging. Students learn at their own pace and way. I hope they enjoy the journey and work together on the issues of aging. On the AJC: Who would have thought that the AJC would regularly have a whole section dedicated to aging? Her legacy: I was a trail-setter, and now I see things happen. If I have any regrets, it\u2019s that I am not 30 years younger, and I cannot be a part of what we have made happen to continue to happen but I am teaching others who will continue to do it. We need to carry on and realize that it is our field.

Emily has been teaching the courses for eight years and also has a course that combines yoga and Pilates into a challenging and fun workout. The two exercise methods complement each other but different in many ways. Emily said, \u201cYoga emphasizes slower movement and holding poses. Pilates is designed for core strength and stability and is typically faster but can be modified for each person.\u201d First introduced in India, yoga has become a popular form of exercise that focuses on being in touch with your body, mind and soul. It can be used to gain strength, flexibility and balance or for relaxation. A yoga class most likely will leave you feeling refreshed and relaxed, yet energized. Pilates is an exercise method that develops muscular strength and flexibility.It was first introduced in New York City by Joseph Pilates and emphasizes good posture, core strength and muscle balance. \u201cAll of this, it\u2019s so good for you. And I feel the difference,\u201d said Patricia Garvey, one of Emily\u2019s students. Here, Emily demonstrates a few yoga poses and Pilates exercises: Roll Ups Roll Ups are an amazing work out for the abdominal muscles. They promote correct, deep breathing, which increases blood flow and circulation. Roll Ups strengthen your spine by increasing its flexibility and improving alignment. Performing this exercise regularly will help your posture in everyday life. You can modify this exercise by bending your knees and keeping your feet on the floor when you roll up. Pilates Push-up This works every part of your body. It helps tone the hips, thighs, abdominal muscles and arms. You can also modify by simply holding a plank instead of completing the push-up to make it work for every student. It\u2019s a wonderful combination of a push-up or plank and the Pilates Roll Down. Single Leg Stretch and Criss Cross The Single Leg Stretch develops the abdominal muscles, encourages core stabilization, and improves a student\u2019s coordination. Doing the Single Leg Stretch correctly and slowly encourages correct breathing from one movement to the next and creates a healthy flow of movement. The Single Leg Stretch can be modified to make it more difficult by lifting the head. A student wanting to do less can simply keep their head on the mat. The Single Leg Stretch flows well into Criss Cross. Criss Cross strengthens the oblique abdominal muscles as well as building pelvic stability and core strength. It\u2019s important to note that the slower you go, the more core strength you can develop. Breathing correctly, and not holding your breath, while performing this exercise also increases the benefits and helps you avoid stress on the neck. Warrior 1 and Warrior 2 Warrior 1 promotes awareness of your body in space through the development of the mind-body connection and engagement of many muscle groups at once, including the muscles of the legs, chest and shoulders. This pose encourages deep breathing and arm variations lead to a feeling of opening the chest. The benefits of Warrior 2 include a feeling of stability while you relax into the position, releasing tension in your upper body. Feelings of peace, renewed focus and better balance are often the result. Pigeon/Proud Pigeon/King Pigeon The pigeon pose is perfect for people with tight hips because it helps stretch the hip flexors and the hip rotators and will lead to a more open feeling in addition to better posture and flexibility. Holding this pose daily for at least 30 seconds will ultimately help you move more easily in your daily life. Less lower back pain and stiffness is another excellent benefit of the pigeon. Variations of the pigeon pose include proud pigeon, with your head facing forward or up, and King Pigeon with your knee bent and foot pointed. Downward Dog, Cobra/Child\u2019s Pose/Dolphin The benefits of Downward Dog include increased strength in your hands, wrists, back, legs and the Achilles tendon. It also elongates the spine and leads to a feeling of openness in your chest. Downward Dog flows well into cobra, which increases flexibility in the shoulders, chest and abdominal muscles, and decreases stiffness in the low back. Going from Downward Dog to Cobra at your own pace is extremely beneficial and doesn\u2019t need to be a fast transition. Child\u2019s Pose is a wonderful place to stretch and breathe in relaxation, and it helps stretch the hips and thighs. The muscles on the front of the body relax while you\u2019re passively stretching the muscles of the back torso; breathe away stress in Child\u2019s Pose. Transitioning to the Dolphin pose from Child\u2019s Pose may feel natural since they usually feel good together. The Dolphin pose helps to stretch your hamstrings and calves while opening your shoulders and chest. Dolphin is also wonderful for people who prefer not to do Downward Dog due to wrist issues.

Instructed by Tyra Burton, an early adopter of blogs and podcasts, the program assists students in understanding how to create brand platforms and capitalize on their social media presence. \u201cI think what people don\u2019t understand about social media is that it\u2019s not going away,\u201d Burton said. \u201cIt\u2019s also something that regardless of your target market, more than likely they are on social media. So whether it\u2019s somebody\u2019s grandpa or grandson, they are on social media and there is a platform that caters to them.\u201d The course has drawn a diverse group of students ranging from recent college graduates, people starting new careers, those learning how to market themselves, social media representatives from existing companies, and bloggers in their 70s. With global social commerce revenues expected to reach an estimated $30 billion by 2015 , more companies are using social media than ever before. Of the Fortune 500 companies, 77% are active on Twitter, 70% have a Facebook page and 69% have YouTube accounts. \u201cI loved the instructor and the energy of the class,\u201d said Barbara Collier, recent program graduate. \u201cIt was great to learn about the evolution of social media and the benefits each platform provides. As a writer, this class helped me successfully use social media to market my new book.\u201d We cover it all in just eight three-hour classes in the evening. Interested?

After earning her Paralegal Certificate in 2009, she has excelled in the courtroom and the community. After being laid off in 2007, Tammie picked up a Workforce Investment Act pamphlet she found at the Department of Labor office in Kennesaw. (WIA was superseded in 2014 by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act which offers similar benefits.) \u201cI thought, \u2018Maybe I need to change careers,\u2019\u201d she recalled. Tammie had always been interested in the legal field and said her education at KSU prepared her for the rigors of the profession. Her experience at different law firms, as an intern and full-time employee, has exposed Tammie to a variety of cases. \u201cWorking in a law office is an adventure every day. I don\u2019t know what type of case I\u2019ll be working on next, and that\u2019s exciting for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant learning experience.\u201d Tammie continued her thirst for legal knowledge by becoming a licensed private investigator and a state-certified process server. She stresses the importance of ongoing education. \u201cWhen you get in the field, don\u2019t stop at your paralegal certificate,\u201d she said. \u201cI take between 50 and 75 hours of continuing legal education (courses) each year because our laws change. You\u2019ve got to change with it.\u201d Her involvement with the Cobb County Legal Professionals Association is another way Tammie sets an example for others. She\u2019s been recognized as Member of the Year and has served as president. She said organizations such as CCLPA are great resources that should be utilized by newcomers to the paralegal field. Interning is another way to make an impression and get some real-world experience, she said. In April, Tammie returned to KSU as an instructor for Law Office Management.

To support University employees, the Office of Strategic Communications and Marketing has compiled a list of best practices to help faculty and staff members on social media prevent and cope with potentially harmful situations.* What is an internet \u201ctroll?\u201d According to Merriam-Webster, trolls are typically characterized as online commentors who deliberately post \u201cinflammatory, irrelevant or offensive comments\u201d with the intent to disrupt messaging. What should you do when you encounter a troll or someone who engages in harassment? If you feel you are in immediate danger, call 911 or contact Kennesaw State University Police at 470-578-6666 . KSU\u2019s Office of Strategic Communications and Marketing will be available to offer advice on how to deal with harassment. You can contact the social media team at socialmedia@kennesaw.edu . You should also escalate concerns to your unit\u2019s executive officer. Avoid responding to inflammatory comments. Trolls tend to move on when they don\u2019t have anything to which they can reply. Document as much of the encounter as possible, including messages, emails, social media posts, and voicemails. Take and save screenshots in case you need to file a police report or take legal action. If you are contacted by members of the media during a troll attack, please contact the Office of Strategic Communications and Marketing before responding to inquiries. Other best practices When publishing something that makes you even the slightest bit uncomfortable, discuss it with your supervisor prior to posting. If you have any questions or concerns about a situation unfolding on social media or social media best practices, contact the social media team within the Office of Strategic Communications and Marketing. *Guidelines compiled using best practices shared by universities nationwide.

What is civil engineering? According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, History and Heritage of Civil Engineering , publication, Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like roads, bridges, canals, dams, and buildings. What is the difference in construction engineering and construction management? The main difference between a construction engineer and a construction manager is licensure. Construction engineers can sit for the Professional Engineer license (PE) but a construction management graduate cannot. In addition, construction managers are not design focused but rather concentrate on construction procedures, methods, and people management. Most will agree that their primary concern is to deliver a project on time, with-in budget, and of the desired quality. What type of careers do Civil Engineers pursue? Civil engineering has five main career specialties: Environmental engineers remove contaminants from water, reduce non-hazardous solid waste volumes, eliminate pollutants from the air and develop groundwater supplies. Geotechnical engineers develop projects below ground and determine ways to support structures on and in the ground. These engineers perfect mixtures for pavements and other structures by developing methods to stabilize soil conditions. Materials engineers develop concrete and pavement systems for construction and soil stabilization methods. Structural engineers face the challenge of designing structures that can withstand gusting winds, extreme temperatures, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural forces. They design structures for bridges, buildings, airplanes, and more. Transportation engineers determine ways to meet the increasing travel needs of people, goods, and materials on land, air, and water. What kind of classes does a civil or construction engineering major consist of? Engineering is a discipline that uses calculus to understand physics and other science-related courses which serve as the foundation for the civil and construction engineering curriculum. When these courses are completed, students move into more major specific classes that are related to the five main career specialties in the field. Where is the civil engineering department located? The Civil Engineering Department is located in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Building (L Building). Can I get a Professional Engineers license with a civil engineering degree and a construction engineering degree? Yes. Per the National Society of Professional Engineers, in order to obtain a Professional Engineers license, one must earn a four-year degree in engineering from an accredited engineering program.

But a brand can be \u2013 and should \u2013 be much, much more. A strong brand is the expression of everything we do, say and deliver. It\u2019s a unifying identity that distills our spirit and serves as a powerful visual reminder of our mission. It has reflections of who we are and points to the promise of what we can become. At KSU we believe in the power of our brand. It\u2019s the articulation of our student-centered focus and our commitment to explore, collaborate and unite a diverse spectrum of backgrounds and talents. It represents openness, challenge and opportunity. It channels the spirit of what it means to be Owls, and it lights the path so that together we all ascend to new heights. The linked KSU Brand Guidebook outlines the core components and key tools that power our brand, providing guidance on how to apply our brand elements across a range of audiences, channels and creative elements. Our brand elements are built to work in harmony, helping brand communicators and ambassadors bring our brand to life each and every day. These stewards of the KSU brand have a responsibility \u2013 a duty to help deliver that brand essence with consistency and power.

During that decade the world would experience two major political shifts, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of the European Union. Germany was reunited and Nelson Mandela became the president of South Africa. There were advances in science and technology, the commercial internet and the iMac both debuted. It was also the decade of the O.J. Simpson trial, the death of Princess Diana and the Branch Davidian raid. In this class will look at these events and more, leading up to the dawn of the 21st century.

While we understand the desire for unique logos, we know that having a single visual element resonates with our many audiences and provides quick, easy and consistent recognition of entities within Kennesaw State University. As such, logos or graphic or visual elements designed outside of the standard identified in this guide will not be permitted. In addition to the official master logo, colleges and other approved units on campus are eligible to use a brand extensions or sub brands provided by Office of Strategic Communications and Marketing. The template for these logos features the Kennesaw State name as well as the college or unit name. The use of symbols such as the ampersand or acronyms are unauthorized and should not appear within an authorized logo. Unique college, school, department and other unit seals, logos or wordmarks may not be used on any university communication, and no new logos may be developed. Approved graphic elements or messaging may not be grouped with the official logo in any way as to appear as a larger composite piece. Additional graphic elements may never be used on letterhead, business cards or forms. Office of Strategic Communications and Marketing is responsible for producing and approving the use of college-specific and unit-specific logos. Requests for college-specific or unit-specific logos should be submitted to logos@kennesaw.edu .

But a brand can be \u2013 and should \u2013 be much, much more. A strong brand is the expression of everything we do, say and deliver. It\u2019s a unifying identity that distills our spirit and serves as a powerful visual reminder of our mission. It has reflections of who we are and points to the promise of what we can become. At KSU we believe in the power of our brand. It\u2019s the articulation of our student-centered focus and our commitment to explore, collaborate and unite a diverse spectrum of backgrounds and talents. It represents openness, challenge and opportunity. It channels the spirit of what it means to be Owls, and it lights the path so that together we all ascend to new heights. The linked KSU Brand Guidebook outlines the core components and key tools that power our brand, providing guidance on how to apply our brand elements across a range of audiences, channels and creative elements. Our brand elements are built to work in harmony, helping brand communicators and ambassadors bring our brand to life each and every day. These stewards of the KSU brand have a responsibility \u2013 a duty to help deliver that brand essence with consistency and power.

For that reason, in some cases the campaign mark should incorporate the dates that the campaign will run. Always use the campaign mark in conjunction with the university's brand and logo. University Example: External Example: Tagline and Slogans Taglines and slogans are similar, but minor differences set them apart. Taglines are more permanent representations of your brand, while slogans can be changed frequently and are often particular to specific campaigns. Both taglines and slogans should be brief and representative of your brand. Tagline The memorable formation of a concise set of words, which capture the unique value a brand offers its audience. University Level: College Level: College of the Arts Bagwell College of Education External Example: Nike Slogan A memorable and catchy phrase, which captures the overarching theme of a marketing campaign. Taglines or slogans should always be used in conjunction with the university brand and logo. External Example: Where\u2019s The Beef? fresh, never frozen Wordmark A wordmark or logotype is a special text-only typographic treatment of a program name or product name used for identification and branding purposes. The wordmark can be based off of a typeface that represents the brand. Wordmarks are only to be used for strategic initiatives of the University. Wordmarks must be approved by the Office of Strategic Communications and Marketing. Graphic Element Think of graphic elements as a brand stylistic extension. Once the big picture of a brand\u2019s messaging has been established, graphic elements serve as visual tools that help carry out this message. Distinct from the singularity of a logo, graphic elements can vary depending on their function, such as representing different categories or sections on an organization's market materials, illustrating the different phases of a company's work processes, or visually denoting different divisions within an organization. Event Related Submissions Events that have pre-existing branding and/or a connection to an overarching brand for example Cancer Awareness and specific holidays that possess a broader perceived theme are exempt concerning for secondary color guidelines. Specific graphics for recurring events must change annually to avoid the perceived creation of new brand identities. University Example: College Example: Branding Assistance The Office of Strategic Communications and Marketing (StratComm) will partner with you to create a campaign mark, wordmark, graphic element, tagline, or slogan. Please reach out at the start of your planning process to involve StratComm. By using the Brand Guidelines and involving StratComm, we can partner together to implement high impact branding that meets your objectives and budget needs, and insure that the elements meet branding guidelines.
