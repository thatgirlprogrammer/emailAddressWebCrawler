In the past year, we have made substantial progress in research growth and productivity thanks to the accomplishments and ongoing efforts of our faculty, staff, and students. As you know, we have had to adapt to new teaching and learning modalities, as well as develop enhanced research safety protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, the number of research proposals submitted increased over this time period relative to the previous year, which demonstrates the perseverance, flexibility, and creativity of our faculty. In response, we have increased the number of staff in Sponsored Programs Administration and streamlined processes with Cayuse, a more robust and efficient grants management system. The Office of Undergraduate Research and the Office of Research Development and Strategic Initiatives continue to thrive and successfully transitioned their programming to an online format when needed.

Restricted or classified research produces results that are not shared broadly. Fundamental research is not subject to export controls when conducted within the borders of the United States. However, fundamental research of any kind occurring abroad is subject to export controls if restricted equipment, software, or information is shipped outside the United States. Export controls are restrictions imposed by the federal government on access to, dissemination of, and transfers of some equipment, software, and data. Providing access to restricted technology or information to those who are not either American citizens, legal residents, or other protected persons while in the United States or while abroad may be considered as an export, re-export, or deemed export. Any item that is sent from the United States to a foreign destination is an export , including software or other technology, design plans, and technical information. The term \u201cdeemed export\u201d refers to the disclosure or release of such items or information to a foreign national within the United States. Principal investigators of projects involving foreign nationals, travel outside the United States, or items shipped outside the United States (including software or other technology, design plans, and technical information) need to consider whether or not their work is subject to export control restrictions. The implications of federal law governing restricted technologies and the involvement of foreign nationals in research or shipment of items outside the United States must be discussed with the Office of Research during the early stages of proposal planning. Violations of export controls can result in major fines against the institution and imprisonment of those individuals held responsible for the violations .

Academic advisors at Kennesaw State University play a transformative role in the student experience through personalized and holistic strategies that promote each student's success. Through a collaborative relationship, we empower all students to take ownership of their education. We provide students with information about program requirements, coursework, campus resources, university policies and procedures, and career options. Embracing cross-campus collaboration, we work alongside faculty to help students become civically engaged, lifelong learners. We are fully committed to fostering a campus environment that respects and values the uniqueness and diversity of the students we serve. When are breaks and other important dates? The dates of the Academic Calendar are maintained by the Office of the Registrar and published each semester. How are students notified in case of an emergency? Kennesaw State University has developed a robust, multi-layered approach to emergency notification. This system is designed to reach the Kennesaw State University students, faculty, and staff in a variety of ways with immediate emergency messaging. Kennesaw State University utilizes outdoor warning sirens, email notifications, text notifications, voice phone call notifications, a desktop override system, the Kennesaw State University webpage, and social media pages to provide emergency messages to our students, faculty, staff, visitors, and other community stakeholders. The goal of this system is to provide multiple points of communication to ensure that the entire Kennesaw State University community is provided with timely and pertinent emergency messaging.

Yes, all students, faculty and staff must have a permit to park in any KSU parking area, including off-site shuttle lots. KSU allows one vehicle per permit to be on campus at a time. If two vehicles are on campus at the same time, both vehicles will be considered in violation, and both will receive a citation.

The event will be hybrid: Students can choose to present in person on the Marietta campus or virtually through Microsoft Teams. Submit an abstract today! Questions? Email our@kennesaw.edu What can be submitted to the Symposium of Student Scholars? The Symposium of Student Scholars accepts all projects submitted by current undergraduate or graduate students. Students who have graduated in the last year but who did the work while a student at KSU are also eligible to present at the Symposium. The Symposium of Student Scholars is designed to showcase student research. We use the following definition of research (adapted from the Council on Undergraduate Research ): A mentored investigation or creative inquiry conducted by students that seeks to make an original scholarly or artistic contribution to knowledge. Some projects submitted to the Symposium of Student Scholars may not fully meet this definition -- for example, the project is a review of other research in the area rather than an original scholarly or artistic contribution to knowledge. We welcome all projects at the Symposium, but only projects that meet the definition of \"research\" will be considered for awards. The application form in the Call for Abstracts section contains a question about which kind of project you are submitting. Call for Abstracts (Deadline: Monday October 31, 2022 at 11:59pm) Click here for the Symposium of Student Scholars application, which is an online application through KSU Digital Commons. (Please note that you may have to set up an account on Digital Commons if you have not done so already.) Abstracts are due Monday October 31, 2022 at 11:59pm . A separate form should be used for each individual project. All projects submitted will be accepted. We encourage ALL graduate and undergraduate students engaging in research/creative activity during the past year to present their work at the Symposium of Student Scholars, showcasing all of the great projects at KSU. Proposals can be submitted as oral presentations, performances, art displays, or posters. *Note: You will need to write an abstract for your submission if you are presenting at the Symposium of Student Scholars. For examples of past abstracts, check out past programs here . For a short (12-minute) video on writing effective abstracts, click here . Schedule (Thursday, November 17, 2022) The event will be held on November 17, 2022 from 11:00am - 5:00pm. The event will be hybrid -- students will present face-to-face on the Marietta campus or virtually using Microsoft Teams.

More Information Here! We welcome you to the second Symposium of Student Scholars to be held on the Marietta campus! If you are new to this campus, please consult this map . Your first stop should be the Gymnasium, where you can check in (remember, this event is part of Scrappy's Bucket List , so you want to make sure to get credit for attending). There is also food and swag in the Gymnasium. From there, you can stay in the Gymnasium to check out the posters. Or, you can head over to the oral presentations that are being held in classroom buildings on campus (exact locations TBA). If you are coming from the Kennesaw campus, you can take the Big Owl Bus. The routes and leave times can be found here . Parking Information on the Marietta Campus If you are new to parking on the Marietta Campus, please consult this map for more information on parking areas. If you need a physical address to any location on the Marietta Campus, you can check here . Faculty/Staff can park in any faculty staff spot on campus. The P 21 lot is a Faculty/Staff lot, and you are welcome to park there. Students from the Kennesaw Campus who have permits should park where their permit allows, which is the same for Marietta. Online students who do not pay for parking will need to park in the P 60 deck in the visitor/pay lot parking. Individuals who are volunteering for the Symposium (e.g., a volunteer, an RSO member staffing a table) can park in P 21 if space is available. Volunteer Opportunities at the Symposium If you are faculty, staff, administrator, postdoctoral researcher, or graduate student, we would love for you to judge session! The survey to sign up to judge can be found here . We are especially in need of volunteers who can judge in person on the Marietta campus. You will receive further instructions, including the specific presentations you are assigned to judge, as we get closer to the event. If you are a moderator of oral presentations, please consult the moderator guidelines here . Posters and Visual Arts Displays In Person : If you are planning to do a poster or a visual arts display in person, you will be assigned a 45-minute timeslot sometime between 11:00am and 5:00pm to display your work in the Gymnasium on the Marietta campus. Those displaying visual art should contact us to coordinate the logistics ( our@kennesaw.edu ). Those of you displaying a poster, please get it printed for free here . Resources for creating effective posters for conferences can be found here and here . Virtual : All virtual presentations will held in Microsoft Teams in 15-minute increments. If you are displaying visual art virtually, you might want to create a powerpoint with photos of your work. If you are presenting a poster, you will need to create a talk about your poster and zoom in on the parts you're referring to as you talk. Each virtual poster presentation will have its own Teams link, so please use it to practice your presentation before the event. Make sure you know how to share your screen, zoom in and out (if necessary), mute noisy attendees, check the chat for questions, etc. Practice with friends! If, during your practice sessions, you type into the chat, don\u2019t worry \u2013 your attendees at the Symposium won\u2019t see what was put in the chat before they join the session (you will still see it though). Oral Presentations and Performances In Person : Oral presentations and performances will be scheduled in classrooms and other spaces on the Marietta Campus in 15-minute increments. We will attempt to schedule similar sessions in a one-hour time block so attendees will be interested in staying for the entire time. Resources for creating effective oral presentations for conferences can be found here and here . If you are preseting a PowerPoint, you should either bring it on a flash drive or email it to yourself so you can pull it up when you arrive. Please arrive at the BEGINNING of the concurrent session so you have time to load up your presentation beforehand. So for example, if you are presenting at 11:30am, you are presenting during Concurrent Session #1, which goes from 11:00am - 11:45am. You should arrive in the designated room around 11:00am so you have time to load your presentation before the Concurrent Session begins. Virtual : All virtual presentations will be held in Microsoft Teams in 15-minute increments. For oral presentations, students typically create a PowerPoint and share their screen while presenting. For performances, you might record the performance and show it, or you could do the performance live with a camera on you. Each virtual oral presentation will have its own Teams link, so please use it to practice your presentation before the event. Make sure you know how to share your screen, zoom in and out (if necessary), mute noisy attendees, check the chat for questions, etc. Practice with friends! If, during your practice sessions, you type into the chat, don\u2019t worry \u2013 your attendees at the Symposium won\u2019t see what was put in the chat before they join the session (you will still see it though). Research Prizes There are prizes for the top presentations by undergraduate and graduate researchers. To view past winners, click here . The judging rubric can be found here . Archived Material Please click here to view programs, photos and listing of prize winners from previous symposiums. Integrating the Event into Coursework Faculty can add the Symposium of Student Scholars to their course syllabi, promoting attendance and/or participation. The event is open to all KSU undergraduate and graduate students and attendance/participation is free. Some ways that faculty can integrate the conference in their coursework include: Encourage students to submit abstracts so that they have an opportunity to present at a university-wide conference where they will get to network with peers and other faculty in a familiar setting. Student can also polish their communication and presentation delivery skills, learn and/or improve their abstract writing abilities, and gain the experience of responding to audience and judges\u2018 questions about their research. Encourage students to attend a specific number of sessions. Example assignments can be: Writing a short reflection on what they learned at the conference. Making connections be tween research from the conference and course content. Critically evaluating research presentations they attend at the conference. Frequently Asked Questions I am choosing the virtual option for presenting and have never presented at a virtual conference before. How can I familiarize myself with the technology and make sure that everything goes according to plan? We will be using Microsoft Teams for presenters who choose the virtual option. Teams will allow multiple people to virtually attend a session. Presenters can share their screen to show a powerpoint, a poster, or other visuals. Attendees can ask questions virtually or by using a chat box within the session. More details on how to specifically use Teams for the Symposium can be found here . How do I find when I'm presenting and the link to do my virtual presentation? Check either the PDF or Excel version of the program to find your time. The links to join virtual sessions are hyperlinks labeled \"Join now.\" Is there a different Microsoft Teams link for presenters versus attendees? No. Everyone uses the same link to join the session. How does a presentation work for a virtual conference? You have been given a 15-minute slot for your presentation. We recommend that you do the following for your presentation: Enter your assigned \"room\" at least 10 minutes before the session starts. Share your screen and show an opening slide so attendees know they've entered the correct \"room.\" We have created a sample opening slide that you can modify, but you can feel free to make your own as well. Information about how to share your screen can be found here . If you are using presentation software like PowerPoint, Prezi, or OneNote: Start your presentation at the assigned time, and go into \"presenter\" mode to make your slides easier to read for the audience. Be sure to leave plenty of time for questions at the end. If you are not using presentation software: We strongly encourage you to turn on your video so attendees have something to look at. More specific details about how to turn on the video feature can be found here . When you're finished giving your presentation, ask the audience if they have any questions. Be sure to check the chat box to see if anyone wrote any questions. Once your 15 minutes are up, many attendees will need to leave to attend other sessions, but you're welcome to stay in your \"room\" to talk to people (the code is unique to your session). Can I start my presentation early or end late? Please do not start your presentation early, as presentations have been scheduled back to back, and attendees might be coming from another session. The link to your session is unique for you, which means you could go later if you wanted to, but we encourage you to end on time so that attendees can head to other sessions if they want. Judges in particular will often not be able to stay late, so they will likely take points off if your presentation is too long. However, we strongly encourage you if you are able to stay in your session and chat with attendees informally if no one has to immediately leave. There is absolutely no problem with informal chats after the official end time for your session. Do I need to submit my PowerPoint to the Office of Undergraduate Research before the Symposium? Not at this time. You will show it during your presentation, and if you'd like, you can attach your presentation to the \"Chat\" in Microsoft Teams if you would like your audience to have access to it. Instructions on how to do that can be found here . Can family and friends come to the Symposium, both virtually and face-to-face? Yes! Everyone, regardless of whether they attend KSU or not, can join in. Here are the instructions on how to join virtual sessions: Download the MS Teams app if you haven't already. Look through the program (either as a PDF or an Excel file) to find the sessions you're interested in attending. At the assigned time or a few minutes before, click on the code to join the session -- a hyperlink called \"Join now.\" Please mute your microphone to avoid disrupting the speaker. I completed a project as an undergraduate or graduate student in the last year, but I have already graduated. Am I eligible to present the research at the Symposium of Student Scholars? Yes - we are happy to accept the research you completed while a student at KSU in the past year. I presented my research at another conference earlier this year (or I will be presenting it later this year). Am I allowed to present the exact same research at the Symposium of Student Scholars AND at another conference? This is normally not allowed because it gives the impression that you have done more research than you actually have. HOWEVER!! In this case, it is permissible. The Symposium of Student Scholars is a chance to show off your work to the campus and larger community; we want to see what you\u2019ve done at these other conferences. If you are creating a resume/vita, you should somehow indicate that the presentation at the Symposium of Student Scholars is the same as a presentation elsewhere. I am in the beginning stages of a research project and won't be ready to present at the Symposium of Student Scholars. Can I still have my work showcased in the program? Definitely! Any student who has engaged in research/creative activity is eligible to get his/her name in the program. You can present the finished research at the next Symposium of Student Scholars, or you can present preliminary data now if you wish. I haven't done any research during the past year, but I'd like to come to the Symposium of Student Scholars just to get a better understanding of what research is. Is this allowed? Definitely! All students, faculty, administrators, staff, and community members are welcome to attend, regardless of whether they have research to present. Attending the Symposium of Student Scholars is an excellent way to see the research opportunities available at Kennesaw State University. Can you ensure that I am judged only by faculty in my discipline? Judges are faculty volunteers; sometimes there are no judges (or not enough judges) from a particular discipline. If you would like to see better representation of your discipline, encourage your professors to attend the Symposium of Student Scholars and sign up to be a judge.

A recent study showed that the most successful students are those who participate in undergraduate experiences, such as internships, undergraduate research, and service learning. These engaged learning opportunities allow students to take what they learn in the classroom and apply it to the real world. Through internships , undergraduate research , and service-learning , students also gain unparalleled opportunities to hone their critical thinking and communication skills. More importantly, these opportunities pay dividends for students well beyond graduation. At Kennesaw State, we believe that doing is the key to learning, which is why we are focused on increasing the number of engaged learning opportunities and giving more students the chance to learn by doing.

Coverage types and limits are recommended minimums and should be increased as appropriate based on contract value and potential risks to the state. Procuring entities should always consult with appropriate risk management experts. The Georgia State Department of Administrative Services, Risk Management Services, can assist entities in risk management. To achieve the appropriate coverage levels, a combination of a specific policy written with an umbrella policy covering liabilities above stated limits is acceptable. The supplier is required to maintain the following insurance coverage\u2019s during the term of the contract: Workers Compensation Insurance (Occurrence) in the amounts of the statutory limits established by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia (A self-insurer must submit a certificate from the Georgia Board of Workers Compensation stating that the supplier qualifies to pay its own workers compensation claims.)

Integrative Biology is an emerging paradigm identified by the National Academy of Sciences. Because biological systems are so complex, solving life science problems requires linking concepts and information between disciplines and organizational scales. The curriculum of Kennesaw State's Master of Science in Integrative Biology (MSIB) advances understanding by providing integrative courses and experiences specifically designed to foster connections across the life sciences spectrum. This approach prepares our students as scientists well-equipped to address pressing issues in the biosciences. Why Kennesaw State's MSIB? Whatever your goals - further graduate study, admission to professional school, employment opportunities or career advancement - our program integrates core biological principles with the flexibility to tailor your education to your needs and interests. We've planned your core coursework to include not only the fundamental life science concepts but also practical aspects that will prepare you to function in the real world of science. Our students center their experience in a thesis focused on a specific research question, working with a thesis advisor they choose from a group of faculty members who work on a wide diversity of organisms including animals, plants and microorganisms. Your thesis advisor will be in the lab or field doing experiments with you, giving you the personal attention you need to succeed. With our well-equipped research facilities, external and internal research funding, and high quality publication record, Kennesaw State's MSIB program offers a unique combination of 'big name' research excellence with 'small school' research mentoring, so you\u2019ll be ready for your next step.

Dyal , Kennesaw State University, GA, USA. Todd D. Smith , Indiana University, School of Public Health - Bloomington, USA. David M. DeJoy , University of Georgia, Athens, USA. Brian A. Moore , Kennesaw State University, GA, USA. Department Health Promotion and Physical Education Document Type Article Publication Date 3-1-2022 Abstract The occupational stress inherent in firefighting poses both physiological and psychological risks to firefighters that have been found to possess a reciprocal nature. That is, the nature of these relationships in terms of indicator and impact are elusive, especially as it relates to sleep health (e.g., quality, quantity, hygiene, etc.) as a specific physiological risk and burnout as a specific psychological risk. A series of mediation models were assessed to examine the reciprocal relationships between occupational stress, burnout, and sleep health in a sample of 161 career firefighters. The mediation models confirmed reciprocity among the variables in so much that relationships were best described by the underlying mechanism at work. Comprehensive assessments of both subjective and objective markers of sleep health should be incorporated into firefighter research to supplement behavioral health assessments and interventions, especially related to burnout and occupational stress.

Electronic address: tc447@cornell.edu. Minhao Dai , Kennesaw State University Shilin Xia , Department of Communication, University of Maryland, College Park, MA 20740, USA. Electronic address: sphxia37@umd.edu. Department School of Communication and Media Document Type Article Publication Date 1-3-2022 Abstract Elderly adults hold different beliefs regarding vaccination and are at higher risks for COVID-19 related illnesses and deaths. The current study aims to explore elderly (aged 65 or above) Chinese adults' intentions to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and the facilitators and barriers to vaccination intentions. We conducted in-depth interviews with 35 elderly adults in China through the lens of the integrative model of behavioral prediction. The results identified a number of facilitators, including convenience (both individual and collective), psychological and physiological wellbeing, collective wellbeing, supportive normative referents, and trust in the government, and some barriers, including vaccine ineffectiveness, side effects, safety, unsupportive normative referents, and the accessibility, affordability, and availability of COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, the results revealed participants' decision-making process: collective wellbeing and trust in the government overrode perceived barriers and perceived individual-level risks, which eventually overwhelmingly led to a high level of intentions to get vaccinated.

METHODS: Participants were assigned randomly into three groups and followed the training sessions allocated at the rate of five sessions/week for 16 weeks. A battery of tests including anthropometric and performance measures were carried out over three sessions: before training (T0), after eight weeks (T1) and sixteen weeks of training (T2). RESULTS: Findings indicated that strength tests demonstrated a significant time effect (P<0.001, \u03b7p=0.6), the results showed that CF and TRAD groups improved strength every 8 weeks while LM group only at T2, The speed test demonstrated also a significant time effect (P<0.001, \u03b7p=0.5) the results showed an improvement in speed every 8 weeks for LM, at T2 for CF and no change for TRAD, for flexibility, all tests demonstrated a main time effect (P<0.001, \u03b7p. 0.46-0.7) CF was the best in shoulder range of motion and LM in trunk and lower limb flexibility, all power tests also demonstrated a significant time effect (P<0.001, \u03b7p: 0.76-0.9) the improvement for all groups was every 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, we recommend TRAD and CF as valuable trainings for strength development, LM for flexibility and all three trainings for power improvement.

We caught up with Forbes to learn more about her experience. How did it feel to participate and win? \u201cIt was exciting to be painting alongside many very talented artists and completing my watercolor within 2 hours,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cThe nervous part was waiting for the judging by Peter Trippi, the editor-in-chief of Fine Art Connoisseur magazine, and Bill Eiland, the director of the Georgia Museum of Art. I was both humbled and thrilled that my painting won 1st place and was immediately purchased by an art collector.\u201d What is \u201cplein air\u201d? \u201cPlein Air\u201d is a French expression, which means \u201cin the open air\u201d and is predominantly used to describe the act of painting outdoors. The Olmsted Plein Air Invitational brought together some of the top plein air artists in the nation to Atlanta. The event helped raise awareness of the beauty of Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s landscape design and benefitted the ongoing work of the Olmsted Linear Park Alliance. Why did you decide to participate in the Paint Quick Competition? \u201cI have painted in several Plein Air competitions throughout Georgia and also enjoy Plein Air painting locally and internationally,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cIt is one of my favorite things to do when I am not inside, teaching in the classroom or creating art in my Atlanta studio. I\u2019ll be Plein Air painting in Barcelona, Spain this June and Venice, Italy, in October.\u201d What other awards has Kathy won? She was also chosen earlier this month to have one of her watercolor paintings, \u201cWoman in Blue,\u201d on display at the Georgia State Capitol in the Office of the Governor through October as part of the \u201cArt of Georgia II: Portraits of a Community\u201d exhibit. It was the second time her artwork has been selected for this honor. Where can Kathy\u2019s artwork be found? Her artwork can be found in private and corporate collections around the world, including the French Olympic Committee in Paris. She is a Signature Member and past President of the Georgia Watercolor Society and has won awards in local, regional and national shows. At KSU\u2019s College of Continuing and Professional Education , Forbes teaches art courses through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute . What would you tell those interested in taking the art courses offered through OLLI? \u201cOLLI has several great drawing instructors. Start with a beginning class in your favorite medium and as you grow in experience try a more advanced class,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cI will be offering a Beginning Watercolor class starting in August on Monday evenings. If you know how to draw and have some painting experience, explore the many painting classes that I and other OLLI instructors teach.

Today, just 100 years later, those numbers have greatly increased to 76.4 and 81.2, respectively (CDC). As a result, by 2030, roughly 31 million Americans will be older than 75, the largest such population in American history (U.S. Census Bureau projections). As quoted in the recent New York Times feature titled As Population Ages, Where Are the Geriatricians? , Terry Fulmer, president of the John A. Hartford Foundation, which funds programs to improve the care of older adults, said, \u201cOne of the greatest stories of the 20th century was that we doubled the life expectancy of adults. Now we need to make sure we have all the supports in place to assure not just a long life but a high quality of that long life.\u201d Program Provides Answer to Aging Population By 2050, its projected there will be 88.5 million Americans aged 65 and older \u2013 more than double that of 2010 (U.S. Census Bureau). The booming elderly population has led to several career opportunities. According to the AJC, services for the elderly and disabled is Georgia\u2019s 3rd-fastest growing job industry with a growth of 56% since 2008. Our Professional Development in Gerontology Certificate program is a direct response to these trends and needs. The course examines the revolution occurring in the U.S. and the world as the average age continues to rise. Students in the Gerontology program will gain increased knowledge, skills and confidence in the aging field, become prepared for emerging roles and new challenges in the aging arena, meet leaders and other professionals in the field and increase their organization\u2019s level of professionalism. \u201cI wanted to be more educated about the aging process and be able to give back to the community,\u201d said Zola Thurmond, program graduate. \u201cThe program was extraordinary. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. It changed my life because I know about the process of aging, what to expect, and how to help others.\u201d The nine-month class runs from September through May. One full-day class (9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) meets on the second Tuesday of each month, providing flexibility for working individuals to attend. Dr. Lois Ricci enters her sixth year of instructing the course. She has worked in the field of aging for more than 35 years in both the hospital and academic settings as a geriatric nurse practitioner/educator and consultant. \u201cDr. Ricci is a true gem,\u201d said Chris Foster, program graduate. \u201cHer vast experience and resources in gerontology were conveyed in a very practical and easy to understand manner.\u201d The class is comprised of interdisciplinary teaching, supportive learning and exposure to leaders in aging applicable to the students\u2019 workplace. It draws from a diverse group of students including those that are dentists, doctors, lawyers, paralegals, nursing students, caregivers and career changers. Registration costs $699 with full and partial scholarship opportunities available. Since its 2007 inception, the program has graduated more than 200 students. Of those, 134 students have been awarded scholarships totaling $73,225 allowing them to take part in the class. \u201cThis course helped me to take care of my parents,\u201d said Fran Crute, program graduate. \u201cBoth of them have dementia, diabetes, and high blood pressure. I really learned a lot and am thankful for this class.\u201d Is Gerontology for You? There are a many reasons why our students register for this program. Perhaps you work in the healthcare industry and want to relate better to the older generation. Or, maybe you want to learn successful techniques to properly care for your parents or grandparents. No matter what your situation is we\u2019d like to invite you to find out more at our upcoming Open House on July 28. The next class is scheduled to begin Tuesday, Sept. 13. Census Data Currently, 1 in 8 individuals in the U.S. is over age 65. (U.S. Census Bureau) The elderly population will more than double between 2000 and 2030. By 2030, 1 in every 4 individuals will be over age 65. (Steuben Senior Services Fund, Inc.) Between 2010 and 2050, the United States is projected to experience rapid growth in its older population.

This class brings together the stretching of yoga and the core strengthening practices of Pilates into a challenging and fun routine appropriate for those interested in improving their fitness levels. Emily has been teaching at the College of Continuing and Professional Education since January 2010. She is an ACE Certified Personal Trainer and a Certified Pilates and Yoga Instructor. Two new daytime classes are being added. \u201cI\u2019m pretty excited about all of it; these are the first new classes I\u2019ve had since 2012,\u201d Emily said. In her classes, Emily doesn\u2019t do things that are very technical and complicated that the students can\u2019t grasp them relatively quickly. A lot of stretching is incorporated in between tough core exercises to ensure that students don\u2019t feel worn out by the end of it but rather refreshed, relaxed, looser and taller. Since lengthening the spine is a big part of Pilates, Emily wants her students to feel like they\u2019ve just had a massage and stretched every part of their bodies. \u201cThe difference between Pilates and yoga is that Pilates is more about developing a stronger core which helps with your lower back pain so it\u2019s a little faster and focused. Yoga has more time for stretching and holding poses a little longer,\u201d Emily said. To combine both, she incorporates a similar warmup in the classes and uses stretching in Pilates as well. Emily Berreth, Pilates and yoga instructor, holds a challenging yoga pose. Emily has taught here at the College for eight years. \u201cI always leave the class feeling that I have stretched each of the major muscle groups in my body and I also have a sense of calm from the relaxation aspect of the class,\u201d student Tina Turczyn said. An essential part of Emily\u2019s teaching is her encouragement for students to focus on their breath. \u201cA lot of times when we do something new or tough, we hold our breath and I encourage my students to never do that. Instead listen to their bodies and pay attention to their breath,\u201d she said. Re-learning to breath correctly takes time and patience and, in her opinion, it\u2019s better to breathe properly and have correct form than to do multiple repetitions of an exercise. She encourages her students to excel and improve every week but to never overdo it. Her classes are focused on not only exercise but fun. Laughter is encouraged. \u201cLaughter is good for the soul and keeps you breathing well too!\u201d Emily said. This keeps students enjoying themselves while exercising and along the way students become friends with each other. \u201cThe social aspect of exercise shouldn\u2019t be forgotten,\u201d she said. Kathy Coyne, another student of Emily\u2019s, said, \u201cWith all the negativity in the world, it is nice to come to class for an hour and a half, let the tension leave and have fun while getting some exercise in.\u201d For more information, visit cpe.kennesaw.edu or give us a call at 470-578-6765.

Deborah Westphal, CPM, ARM, is the instructor of the Fundamentals of Residential Property Management Certificate and executive director for the Institute of Real Estate Management of Georgia. Here, as featured in the Cobb Business Journal , she shares insight on how the property management industry is changing and what employers are looking for: For the past 10 years, the Institute of Real Estate Management has been aggressive in its efforts to attract more talent and urge students to consider property management as a career choice. One of the key strategies for doing this is through connections with colleges and universities \u2014 supporting efforts to establish new real estate and property management certifications and degree programs. Throughout the multi-family housing sector, retention and talent management remain top priorities for company leaders as economic conditions improve and competition for high performers increases. Competition for top talent brings pressure for increased compensation as well as a higher baseline for performance. The use of analytics are becoming the norm to measure performance across all areas including customer satisfaction, retention, service and net operating income. A look at industry stats: Georgia has had a 4.9% increase in property management jobs compared to the nation\u2019s increase of 6.5%. Females continue to dominate the industry, made up of 62% females and 38% males. In residential property management, 47% of employees are between 25-44 years of age, followed closely by 44% between the ages of 45-64, with only 3% of all employees between the ages of 19-24. Today\u2019s successful real estate degree programs, first and foremost, are aimed at preparing students to move directly and easily into careers in real estate. Students not only are learning the theory \u2014 they are learning how to apply it and what the theory looks like in real life. This comes from both what is taught in the classroom and internships that are required in most real estate programs. Organizations like IREM , National Apartment Association and Georgia Apartment Industry Education Foundation are promoting careers in our industry as a way to attract more qualified individuals into real estate careers. As baby boomers retire over the next seven to 10 years, more emphasis will be placed on identifying, hiring and developing the emerging superstars. Successful real estate and property management programs are responsive to industry needs and the new realities of the profession. Leaders in the real estate industry often refer candidates to companies with openings. According to longtime real estate professionals Dr. Debbie Phillips and Sherle Brown, employers want students who have the following: Customer service orientation Critical thinking skills Ability to understand a complex legal environment Conflict resolution skills Creative approach to problem solving At the College of Continuing and Professional Education, we train students in these topics through a variety of methods: Interactive learning Access to industry leaders Case study analyses Lectures and presentations We are also working will also be working with several instructors in an effort to expand the curriculum to include more legal aspects of the industry as well as a more advanced level of training. The future is looking brighter for the real estate industry, and training students to be prepared for this influx of business opportunities is a top priority.

She currently works for Croy Engineering as a paralegal for the 2016 SPLOST Program, Right-of-Way Department. Our Paralegal Certificate is our longest-running certificate program , with 31 years. The University Professional & Continuing Education Association named the Paralegal Certificate a Program of Excellence at its Fall 2014 UPCEA South awards conference. In 2014, we unveiled the Joe R. Edwards Law Library which features more than 3,000 donated law books. During her time at CCPE Audrey took as many classes at a time to be able to graduate sooner. The program consists of 13 courses. Each course meets for three hours one night per week for six weeks. You arrange your own schedule; you can take one to four courses per six week session. Students receive hands-on experience in our on-site law library, a tour at the Cobb County Court House and conduct a title search in Cobb County. Audrey was able to take Jeff Gaba\u2019s Real Estate Law class, and it was after this class that an opportunity arose to work with one of Jeff\u2019s partners. Audrey secured the job and now works with Jeff and his team as well as other attorneys in Marietta. \u201cThis certificate has allowed me to obtain a career I never thought was possible,\u201d Audrey said. \u201cI absolutely love my job and what I do.\u201d Our program intrigued Audrey due to her love of the law and every aspect of it. During the program, she gained new skills such as becoming more detail oriented, improving her organizational skills, and learning how to improve emails. \u201cThe research that I did alongside my attorney was extremely educational. He mentored me in a way and set me on my path to where I am today. I\u2019m very thankful,\u201d Audrey said. She encourages those coming into the program to join Cobb County Legal Professional Association before they graduate. \u201cIt is a fantastic group of people and they can also help you in your search for employment,\u201d said Audrey. \u201cAlso, my advice would be to not give up. This program will give you insight and knowledge for you to take to any job that is offered to you. Good luck!\u201d For more information, visit cpe.kennesaw.edu or give us a call at 470-578-6765.

In addition, many student services and information are delivered via technology. To provide the KSU student with a quality education delivered most conveniently, technology is used as an essential part of instruction, for student access to educational materials, and for the delivery of student services. A technology fee is collected each term to provide students with improved technological resources including: greatly enhanced access to the internet; general and academically-specific software packages delivered online via virtual computing labs; training in the use of computer and audio visual technology; extended computer laboratory hours; electronic study rooms in the Sturgis Library, and extended hours for technical support for campus applications. The Kennesaw State University website exists to assist students with course registration, the reviewing of grades, and access to the learning management system. In addition, the KSU website delivers quality mobile content for smartphones and tablets. Each year brings new technology, more creative uses of technology on campus, and additional services to meet growing needs. Mandatory KSU E-Mail Account KSU generated e-mail accounts are the official means of communication with students. Instructions can be found at kennesaw.edu/myksu/ KSU\u2019s Vice President for Operations and Chief Information Officer/Chief Business Officer The Chief Information Officer (CIO) & Vice President of Information Technology provides leadership in the continuing advancement of information and instructional technology. This position oversees the operations of information technology, which includes the University Information Technology Services division and the technical infrastructure of the KSU Library System The KSU Library System The KSU Library System includes two libraries, the Horace W. Sturgis Library located on the Kennesaw Campus, and the L.V. Johnson Library located on the Marietta Campus. Their locations and contact information are as follows: Horace W. Sturgis Library (Kennesaw Campus) 385 Cobb Avenue NW, MD1701 Kennesaw, GA 30144 Departments & Services: Check Out Desk - 470-578-6202 Research Help - 470-578-6325 Interlibrary Loan - 470-578-6002 L. V. Johnson Library (Marietta Campus) 910 Hornet Loop Marietta, GA 30060 Departments & Services: Check Out Desk - 470-578-7276 Research Help - 470-578-7471 Mission / Vision The mission of the Kennesaw State University Library System is to support and further KSU\u2019s mission of being a powerful, diverse, student-centered, and research-driven university. The Library System carefully cultivates resources, services, and spaces that enhance teaching, learning, scholarship, and creative endeavors for our users. These efforts focus upon supporting student success - especially advancing undergraduate programs, supporting the graduate programs, furthering research with relevance, and promoting lifelong learning. The vision of the KSU Library system is to advance student success, lifelong learning, and research with relevance through teaching, access, and discovery with the expertise and dedication of our professional faculty and staff. Library Resources The Kennesaw State University Library System holds a growing number of carefully cultivated resources and services designed to assist students and faculty. Collections include over 104,000 e-journal titles; 800,000 e-books; 14,000 Federal Serial Sets (approximately 9.7 million pages); 62,000 federal maps; 1,300,000 music scores; over 10,000,000 audio recordings; and 100 collections of data-sets representing over 12,000,000 data points. The KSU Library System proudly hosts and maintains the university\u2019s institutional repository, the Digital Commons, which is home to 13,374 resources and over three million downloads worldwide. Because the KSU Library System is a participating member of GALILEO Interconnected Libraries (GIL), students and faculty have access to and borrowing privileges from the collections in all of Georgia\u2019s public college and university libraries as well as a number of private university libraries. GALILEO and GIL provide access to the collections of the finest doctoral research university libraries in the state. The comprehensive holdings of Georgia\u2019s virtual library system include over 10 million volumes and thousands of full-text periodicals accessible through 384 electronic databases. Consequently, the discipline-specific library resources available to support the KSU colleges and programs are extensive. KSU is also a charter member of LYRASIS, a national and international bibliographic cooperative in library resource management. LYRASIS uses its large library membership to secure discounted purchasing prices and licensing fees for a wide variety of eResources and eContent materials. Federal Government Documents Depository Located at the Johnson Library on the Marietta campus, the KSU Library System houses a partial Federal Government Documents Depository for the 11th Congressional District. Library Services As a physical and digital library system, we emphasize access to library services regardless of location or need, whether that is, on campus, at off-campus locations, and/or via distance learning technologies. The physical libraries are open about 100 hours per week on each campus with extended hours during exams. For research assistance, the libraries offer both assistance in the libraries as well as a 24/7 chat service where users can receive remote assistance from a librarian at any time. The Library System also offers in depth one-on-one research consultations, both remote and in person. Online library resources are accessible via individual user login authentication all day, every day, and online and distance education students also benefit from ubiquitous access to high-quality information resources. Each library offers orientation sessions and information literacy instruction in a variety of formats, including course integration. For resources external to the KSU Library System, the libraries offer robust borrowing and loan programs. The university\u2019s Archives and Special Collections are also located within the libraries and are available via appointment. Study Spaces Both individual and group study spaces are available at both libraries. In the Sturgis Library, the ground floor provides a community space where students have access to-computers and printers. The 1st floor learning area is called OwlSpace, and it is a \u201cnoisy\u201d space where students are free to collaborate and work on group projects. OwlSpace also includes computers and multiple presentation rooms. The third floor offers a quieter study area containing individual study cubicles as well as seven glassed-in study rooms for quiet group study, and a printer and microfilm reader. In the Johnson Library, the first floor Hive area is a \u201cnoisy\u201d community space where students have access to computers and communal seating. The second floor provides access to quiet study rooms for group study and individual study cubicles. Borrowing Privileges KSU students and faculty have borrowing privileges not only from the KSU Library System but also from all of the member institutions in the University System of Georgia as well as the Atlanta Regional Consortium for Higher Education (ARCHE). Through the SuperSearch discovery tool, students can instantly access millions of resources including books, ebooks, journals, databases, videos, and government documents. Mobile versions of the library catalog and databases are available. Interlibrary Loan services may be used for items not owned by one of the participating Georgia libraries. Digital Commons The KSU Library System hosts the DigitalCommons@Kennesaw State University. The Digital Commons is a digital resource for KSU\u2019s intellectual and creative out-put. With the increase in KSU\u2019s graduate programs, the Library System uses the Digital Commons to self-publish dissertations, theses, and capstone projects and make them available online. These resources are fully searchable by keyword or author and are indexed by major search engines such as Google Scholar.
