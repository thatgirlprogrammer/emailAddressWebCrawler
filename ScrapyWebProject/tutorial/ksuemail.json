The CCSE Hackathon is open to all KSU students. For students that do not already have a team, don't worry! We will pair you with a team based on your strengths and weaknesses. This is an excellent opportunity to hone your skills. Each industry sponsor will present challenges related to their thread of industry. Multiple challenges are possible for each sponsor. In each of these challenges, students will be chosen to form teams of 3 or less to solve these challenges presenting the best of our students in Computer Science, Information Technology, Software Engineering, Game Development, and KSU as a whole. Many different skillsets on every team are desired for the best results for our industry leaders. The offical CCSE Discord channel will be the main platform for sponsor mentoring during the Hackathon. Each sponsor will have their own unique channel and students participating in their challenge will be able to join.

(Jul 2, 2020) \u2014 Luis Cuevas has always considered himself to be a Disney fan. He spent his childhood watching all of the classic films and says his favorite book is The Ride of a Lifetime, a memoir written by longtime Walt Disney Company chief executive Bob Iger. So when he learned of Kennesaw State University\u2019s new Disney Interactive Entertainment Study Program, the journalism student leapt at the opportunity to apply his studies toward learning the magic behind a company he has long admired. \u201cI knew that gaining an insider\u2019s perspective on how an industry leader works was going to be a key takeaway for me,\u201d Cuevas said. \u201cThinking through how a brand like Disney continues to grow and adapt was something that has always inspired me, and this course was exactly what I needed to challenge my creativity.\u201d Cuevas was one of nearly 30 students who recently took part in the program offered by the Joel A. Katz Music and Entertainment Business Program (MEBUS) and the College of Computing and Software Engineering (CCSE). Conceived as an affordable \u201cstudy away\u201d option, the four-week program is designed to give students a deep dive on how Disney and its many properties continue to pioneer world-changing entertainment technology. In its original format, students would study on campus for three weeks and spend one week at Walt Disney World to learn how the company applies the technology in its theme parks to generate unforgettable experiences. As part of the program, students were allowed to choose from four courses with topics including 3D modeling and animation, and entertainment media production. While the coronavirus pandemic ultimately prevented students from visiting the parks this year, CCSE Dean Jon Preston said the program stayed the course by offering students an interdisciplinary approach to studying the Disney creative process, albeit remotely. \u201cOne of the core elements of this program \u2013 whether it was from a video production, creative adaptability, 3D graphics or animation standpoint \u2013 was looking at best practices for Disney and studying the kinds of experiences they are known to create,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still hung on to that Disney approach to excellence in the courses, which was paramount for our students.\u201d Keith Perissi, MEBUS director and senior lecturer of music entertainment, said the program is the result of a longtime collaboration between MEBUS and CCSE. Though they are different courses of study at Kennesaw State, he said students representing the two are able to bond over a common language: technology. \u201cWhen you mix those two worlds together, it\u2019s like magic,\u201d Perissi said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of our students for being able to pivot and make this a really unique experience.\u201d Perhaps no course made the pivot easier than one in creative adaptability, he added. The course is designed to help students understand the business of creativity by giving them hands-on experiences in project building. For the Disney Interactive Entertainment Study Program, this meant learning how Disney was able to work through its own creative process to adapt to the onset of COVID-19. Midway through the course, students were treated to a live video call with Dan Cockerell, a longtime Disney employee who most recently served as vice president of the Magic Kingdom Park. Cockerell shared with the class his own experiences within the Disney brand and imparted advice on harnessing the creative process. The course culminated with students taking Disney properties, such as Pixar, Lucas Films and Marvel, and generating pitches for how those properties could be repurposed into short films, feature films or television series under the constraints of the pandemic. \u201cThe course really taught me how to look at things from a different perspective and learn how to create under atypical circumstances,\u201d said Skylar Cleland, whose project focused on the backstory of Frozone from \"The Incredibles.\" \u201cIn a way, I think COVID-19 enhanced this course and challenged us to think outside the box. It was memorable not only for the challenge it presented to me, but to also see how creative my classmates could be with their own projects, and I really hope to see them all come into fruition one day.\u201d Erin Lyles, a public relations student who chose to pitch a new Pixar short film that explores the colors of someone\u2019s aura, said the program has forever changed the way she approaches a project. \u201cMy final project was super impactful to me because I think I made it a lot more personal than I had intended to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helped me grow, and it is something that will always be on my mind until I make it a reality.\u201d Written by Travis Highfield Photos submitted Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Current Students Online Only Students Faculty & Staff Parents & Family Alumni & Friends Community & Business Related Links Libraries Housing Financial Aid Degrees, Majors & Programs Registrar Job Opportunities Campus Security Global Education Diverse & Inclusive Excellence Sustainability Accessibility Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) \u00a9 2022 Kennesaw State University.

Less \"windshield time\" means more time for virtual visits, so if I haven't been to your school, maybe this is the time. I'm very willing to learn the remote software that your school uses, so please check my calendar and let me know how I can help! We at the College of Computing and Software Engineering will continue to support our K-12 partners in four ways: Content specifically developed for virtual learning Development of new content for virtual learning Existing content applicable to virtual learning Synchronous live presentations using KSU's Blackboard Collaborate Ultra, Microsoft Teams, or your school's presentation tool. Content ready for virtual learning is listed immediately below. For development of new content or to schedule a synchronous live presentation, please contact me directly at Bob.Brown@Kennesaw.edu . Content Specifically Developed for Virtual Learning Find the Pok\u00e9mon: The Importance of Algorithms (Grades 5-9) In this video, we learn about the importance of algorithms and choosing the right algorithm for a given task by playing a \"Find the Pok\u00e9mon Game.\" Along the way we meet Bill and Gina, school kids who play along with us. We discover two different algorithms for finding a hidden Pok\u00e9mon and learn when to choose one over the other. This video can be played online or downloaded. Handout, game sheets, and transcript are included. 18 minutes. Best Practices for Academic Success (Grades 9-college) In this eight-minute video, Dr. Brown recalls the advice he gave students in his classes about note-taking and studying. Transcript and slides are available with the video. Introduction to Binary Numbers (Grades 3-5) Students make their own binary counting cards, then learn to manipulate binary numbers following instructions in a video. This video can be played online or downloaded. Handout, printable counting cards, and transcript are included. 13 minutes. Existing Content Applicable to Virtual Learning Binary Numbers (Grades 6-8) A narrated video and additional content to help teachers present virtually. Boolean Logic: Kat's Cat Checker Narrated video and additional material. Cryptography Narrated video and additional material. Cryptography, Exploring Further Narrated video describing the Vigen\u00e8re Cipher, handouts with exercises, and links to Wikipedia. About Dr. Brown Dr. Bob Brown, a retired KSU faculty member, can present the following at schools or other locations in the Atlanta area. For dates, please see his availability calendar . These presentations are geared toward middle school and high school students, but can be adapted for other audiences, including elementary school students. Contact Bob at Bob.Brown@Kennesaw.edu for details or to schedule a presentation or get my vCard or public key . Bob is a Raspberry Pi Certified Educator . Presentation Topics Algorithms and searching: This is a single 50-minute presentation based on the Battleships activity from CS Unplugged , revised to use Pok\u00e9mon instead of battleships. Students work in pairs to locate each other's Pok\u00e9mon, first performing a linear search, then a binary search, and, time permitting, a hashed search. The concept of algorithm is introduced and formally defined. Students learn that some algorithms are more efficient than others, and Big-O notation is introduced briefly. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the importance of selecting the correct algorithm. Curriculum elements include comparing numbers for equality and inequality, coordinates, algorithms, efficiency of algorithms, and searching. Binary numbers: This is a single presentation of about 50-minutes that introduces binary numbers. It was designed for grades 6-10, but has been presented successfully to third-graders. The session outline and objectives are included in the teacher notes . If I present this, I will furnish a set of binary counting cards for each student, but we ask schools to duplicate the handout. I have fun presenting this, and I hope you'll invite me to do so, but I've packaged it into a teachers' kit that will let teachers present it independently with minimal pre-work. Boolean Logic: Kat's Cat Checker: This is the logic-only part of the Digital Logic series, condensed to a one-period presentation. Katherine, Kat for short, is headed to Hogwarts, and uses logic to specify the ideal cat to take with her. This may be best suited to grades 8 to 12. Careers in computing: This is a 15- to 50-minute presentation, depending on the time available, in which I discuss a number of careers in the computing field and end by suggesting that students also consider becoming a college professor. Coding fundamentals with Python: This one is under development at a middle school; help me work on it. I'm working on a presentation of about eight or nine contact hours. I'm looking for another school to work with me. Cryptography, introduction: A single 50-minute session that introduces substitution and transposition ciphers, beginning with the C\u00e6sar Cipher. Students decrypt a message encrypted with the rail-fence cipher, then create a keyword substitution cipher. The presentation is available as a narrated-slide video . The accompanying handout is available as a PDF . Cryptography, public key: A single 50-minute presentation that demonstrates the workings of modern public key cryptography, including digital signatures. This one is all lecture, with no classroom activities, and so is best suited to grades 10-12. There is a take-home exercise in which students generate their own public/private key pair. Cryptography exercises: These are optional exercises for students who want to go beyond the exercises in the handouts. The exercises cover the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, the one-time pad, and public key cryptography. Digital logic: I've presented this several times with refinements after each. It shows students that there's no magic in computers. There is an outline and objectives document available; I am very willing to adapt it to your curriculum. Handouts for all three days are available to download, and there's a video of day 3. Students need a basic understanding of binary numbers. This might fit best in grades 8 to 12. This requires the free software package Digital Works. If installation of software is a problem, I can bring copies for each student on CD. Information Security : This is a series of three presentations with a target audience of grades 7-10. It is probably best to do these once a week or every other week for three or six weeks rather than all at once. The three sessions are Information Security Fundamentals, Encryption, and Threat Analysis. There is more detail in the outline and objectives. Micro:Bit: This is a series of eight 50-minute sessions in which students learn the fundamentals of programming using the Micro:Bit device. Programming differs from \"coding\" in depth and breadth. Students learn \"coding\" and also some of the science behind software development. Raspberry Pi : What we can do depends on the school's objective, the equipment available, and the time available. If you have Raspberry Pi equipment, I can help your teachers get ready to use it in the curriculum. I can work directly with students to get them started building Raspberry Pi projects. I can help your school start a Code Club and provide some assistance in the operation of the club. If the Raspberry Pi is new to you, it's a $45 computer that can be used for making physical projects. The $45 is for a bare computer; you will end up spending $80-200 per pair of students to equip a Raspberry Pi lab. I've prepared an annotated shopping list to help you get started. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has more details. Sphero SPRX: I'm working with a middle school to teach block programming to sixth graders using the Sphero environment. The program will be eight or nine lessons, and I'm looking for a second school to work with me. Need something else? I am very willing to prepare new material to suit your needs or curriculum. Contact me and we can probably work something out. I'm also available to help with curriculum development, professional development, and the development of learning objects. Contact me at Bob.Brown@Kennesaw.edu to work out the details. Details There is no fee for any presentation, but we do ask that schools duplicate any handout material that may be required. When I present at a school, a teacher must be present at all times and be responsible for classroom management. The presentations listed are designed for a room with a projector and a Windows computer that can show PowerPoint with video and sound. If you let me know, I can bring a suitable laptop with HDMI video and audio output. I can also present without audiovisual aids if you give me plenty of notice.

The event gives students from Georgia\u2019s colleges and universities an opportunity to present their research to state leaders. This fourth annual event is an initiative of the Georgia Undergraduate Research Collective (GURC). \u201cWe are so pleased to have five KSU students accepted to this event by Georgia legislators,\u201d said Amy Buddie, director of undergraduate research at KSU. \u201cWith the introduction of the \u2018Advancing Community and Culture\u2019 pillar to the Roadmap to R2 success, this event helps show our state\u2019s decision-makers that students at KSU and elsewhere are conducting meaningful, relevant research that makes a difference in our community.\u201d The selected KSU students are Destini Chambers, Jessie Chen, Gabrielle Jones, Nathaniel Jones and Luci Wilgus. Their research presentations will cover a range of disciplines. Brains and motion Destini Chambers Chambers, a junior studying engineering, is looking at the prediction of intent to start and stop movement by using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from the brain. She is using that data to create a Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) system that can be used in vehicles to protect pedestrians. \u201cI was initially fascinated by the analysis of the human brain and how to examine its fluctuations during the decision-making process,\u201d she explained when asked why she was influenced to conduct this research. Analysis of redistricting Jessie Chen As a senior studying computational and applied mathematics, Chen attended a Faculty Research Spotlight, a series of research talks intended for undergraduate students in the mathematics department, featuring Dr. Andrew Wilson. The research topic focused on applying mathematics to redistricting of congressional districts. Through Chen\u2019s research, she was able to gain valuable experiences in seeing how math can be applied outside of the classroom. \u201cI was able to get a glimpse into how mathematical research is done and see the significance of coding in computational mathematics,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring the process of this research project, I felt that what we did was directly related to the real world, which was a nice addition to this experience.\u201d Diversity on television Gabrielle Jones Gabrielle Jones\u2019 will present her work with a focus on screenwriter, Chris Nee, and her work to diversify children's television. As a sophomore studying media and entertainment, Jones explains, \u201cGrowing up, I never saw people who looked like me on screen; through this research project, I get to uplift women who have done amazing work but are not getting credit for it.\" Her presentation highlights a woman whose work to increase diversity in children's television led to educating youth in better ways to create new conversations and tell new stories. \u201cDoes the Pell Grant come with a Price?\u201d Nathaniel Jones Pursuing a master\u2019s in applied statistics and analytics, Nathaniel Jones\u2019 research explores the differences in academic outcomes, debt accumulation and school-type of post-secondary schools with either a majority or minority proportion of students receiving a Pell Grant. Through the experience of this research project, Jones gained experiences in presenting, public speaking, networking with other student researchers at conferences, and collaborating with his mentor Susan Mathews Hardy, senior lecturer of statistics. Curating history Luci Wilgus Wilgus, a freshman anthropology major, is conducting research on best practices for information storage, cataloging, and accessibility. The secondary research required includes arranging individual printmaking equipment in terms of origin, model, and estimated age of each piece. \u201cThe opportunity to be a curator appealed to me as I am interested in using my degree in anthropology to work in a museum setting,\u201d explained Wilgus. \u201cI have always been fascinated by antiques and the arts.\u201d \u2013 Meagan Lowney Related Stories Kennesaw State honors student researchers in annual Birla Carbon Scholars Symposium Kennesaw State researcher receives grant to study pollution effects in birds 3D Printing Ecosystem transforms education at Kennesaw State University Weeks of Welcome A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

As the director of the School of Data Science and Analytics at Kennesaw State University, Hayes believed his background in conflict management would mesh well with the Diplomacy Lab\u2019s mission, which is to broaden the State Department\u2019s research base and engage the American people in diplomacy work by partnering with universities. However, Hayes admits he was surprised to learn about the interdisciplinary aspects. Sherrill Hayes \u201cPeople often ask: What is diplomacy? I tend to think about diplomatic problems, negotiation and mediation. But in fact, the Department of State needs help with several STEM-based problems as well,\u201d said Hayes, who currently serves as the director of the Diplomacy Lab. KSU was accepted into the Diplomacy Lab program two years ago and is one of 43 universities participating. Each semester, the State Department releases dozens of proposals, and faculty members bid on projects that match their strengths and expertise. If chosen, faculty use the talents of graduate and undergraduate students who, through this partnership, are able to contribute directly to the policymaking process. \u201cWe have an enormous university, and we have faculty expertise across an entire range of disciplines,\u201d said Hayes, who is determined to expand these opportunities to more colleges on campus. \u201cI have long been a believer in real-world projects, and I am committed to finding opportunities for students to do relevant research. The Diplomacy Lab allows students and faculty to work on projects that make a difference in our society.\u201d Meaningful Research This fall, KSU was awarded three Diplomacy Lab projects, which included geographic information system mapping for global embassies and a project researching the use of artificial intelligence to accelerate the transition to green energy. The third project, led by Shirley Tian and Zhigang Li, both assistant professors of information technology in the College of Computing and Software Engineering, analyzed the effect of COVID-19 on the international airline travel industry. Tian and Li oversaw two groups of graduate students and one group of undergraduate students as they used data to determine, for example, the net effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on international air travel and how vaccination rates and daily confirmed case numbers of different regions have affected the airline industry since March 2020. \u201cWhat we are doing is interesting and meaningful,\u201d Tian said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for faculty and students to work together on these projects, which help organizations all over the world. Students who are interested in pursuing a career in data analysis or a career in the government after graduation have these projects on their resumes, and it\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\u201d For senior information technology student Sarah Solomon, the opportunity to do research on this Diplomacy Lab project has helped with long-term and short-term goals. \u201cLearning to analyze the data and work as a team on this project has opened my eyes to the research I could pursue in a master\u2019s degree program,\u201d Solomon said, noting the relevance of the current work. \u201cCOVID-19 has affected almost every aspect of our lives. Looking at its impact on the airline travel industry has real-world implications, and I\u2019m excited to be a part of this team.\u201d The research on COVID-19\u2019s impact on the international airline industry follows a previous Diplomacy Lab project that gained attention from senior State Department officials. In the fall of 2020, Tian, Li and several students were tasked with analyzing data to determine how social media messages posted on government accounts influenced the rate of COVID-19 infections. As a result of their research, the team was one of a select few invited to participate in the Diplomacy Lab Demo Day, where they presented their findings to top State Department officials. The invitation was a highlight of the partnership so far for Hayes. \u201cThe opportunities for students and faculty to show these top officials what they can do at Kennesaw State is huge, and it raises the profile of the University,\u201d he added. For Tian, it was further motivation to continue her work on Diplomacy Lab projects for years to come. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of the students who worked together and applied their knowledge to such a relevant challenge in our world,\u201d Tian said about their research on COVID-19 impacts. Innovative Solutions While the topic of COVID-19 has been popular in the Diplomacy Lab, there have been several other successful projects at KSU. In the spring of 2021, doctoral students joined political science professor Charity Butcher to evaluate the State Department\u2019s global peacekeeping operations. They not only provided a review of existing studies on effective peacekeeping, but also developed an evaluation tool the State Department could use to assess the efficacy of peacekeeping missions. Students on the project said the State Department appreciated their work, and it was gratifying to participate in research with such practical applications. In 2019, computer science professor Dan Lo brought together a team of undergraduate and graduate students to develop a computer program that uses natural language processing to identify trends in social media posts on Weibo and WeChat. The social media platforms are widely used in China, and it was research Lo was already working on when the Diplomacy Lab asked for help. \u201cThis was an easy pivot to expand upon research already being done at Kennesaw State,\u201d Hayes said. Lo\u2019s research resulted in two papers accepted by the second International Workshop on Big Data for Marketing Intelligence and Operation and the 2019 IEEE Conference on Big Data. Hayes, the self-described \u201cconduit\u201d of the Diplomacy Lab program, said it is an irreplaceable experience that taps into the potential of students and faculty members, and he hopes more colleges at KSU will get involved. \u201cThis partnership emphasizes research with relevance, and it ties in with our community engagement objectives,\u201d he added. \u201cI look forward to the impact it will continue to have on our students, faculty and society.\u201d \u2013 Abbey O'Brien Barrows Related Stories Kennesaw State Academy for Inclusive Learning grad built skills for rewarding career Kennesaw State economic impact increases to more than $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2021 Kennesaw State University, Georgia Fintech Academy help bridge the Fintech industry talent gap A trio of Kennesaw State students spreads the gospel of ecology and conservation through engaging social media content A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

Students will be receiving an email soon inviting them to activate their official KSU Merit page. Kennesaw State automatically updates students\u2019 Merit pages with accomplishments such as making dean\u2019s or president\u2019s lists, earning scholarships, presenting research at a conference, studying abroad, or participating in student competition teams. In addition, students can customize their profile pages with pictures, work and school experience, and awards earned. Following are answers to some frequently asked questions about the platform: How do Merit Pages benefit students? Merit creates a personal record of each student\u2019s academic career, showcasing achievements and activities. A Merit page also is useful for seeking a job, with options to upload a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and list employment history. Hundreds of colleges around the country use Merit Pages to recognize and promote student success, so Owls who opt in will join a national network of college students. Also, Merit updates are shared with students\u2019 high schools, hometown news outlets and state legislators. Merit pages can be connected to social networks such as Twitter, Instagram or LinkedIn, ensuring that friends and family are able to see and learn about the great activities students are participating in and being recognized for at Kennesaw State. How does Merit work? Merit is an automated email system managed by KSU Strategic Communications and Marketing. When students earn recognition, the University publishes a personalized article to Merit and sends it to the hometown newspapers, high schools and government officials of each student involved. Each time new content is added to their Merit page, students receive an e-mail with a link to view their story and share their achievements with friends and family. Parents also receive an email allowing them to share their students\u2019 accomplishments on their own social media channels. How do students update or customize their Merit pages? After a student logs into their personal Merit page, they can create a customized URL, add a profile picture and bio, and connect to their social media profiles. They also can make changes to personal information such as email address, hometown and major. How is students\u2019 privacy protected? Kennesaw State respects students\u2019 privacy. The content KSU shares through Merit includes only information about students that is designated as \u201cdirectory information under the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Student pages are set by default to be private and are not searchable on kennesaw.meritpages.com, unless students adjust their profile settings to make their pages searchable. However, stories containing students\u2019 first and last names automatically will be shared with hometown news outlets, high schools and state legislators. How can students opt out? Opting out removes a student\u2019s profile from Merit Pages and prevents the University from publishing future achievements by that student. Students can opt out at any time by following these instructions from Merit. To learn more about Merit Pages and to see published stories, visit Kennesaw State\u2019s Merit site .

Brian Kliszczewicz and Robert Buresh Brian Kliszczewicz, associate professor of exercise science , and Robert Buresh, professor of exercise science, have received a three-year, $380,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health to study the effectiveness of a novel high-intensity bodyweight circuit training regimen that offers a more time-conscious path to treat and manage Type 2 diabetes. Conventional guidelines call for 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise a week to maintain a healthy lifestyle, but Kliszczewicz said this time commitment often deters many people from engaging in exercise. He and Buresh devised this circuit to cut down the time required, make exercise more accessible to those who might benefit from it, and ultimately help prevent the advancement of Type 2 diabetes. \u201cThe best exercise program is one people will stick with,\u201d Kliszczewicz said. \u201cGiven that a lack of time is a commonly reported barrier to exercise, a regimen of short-duration, high-intensity exercise is promising for helping patients develop and maintain healthy habits while also managing diabetes.\u201d Preliminary data from the KSU researchers suggest that Type 2 diabetes patients, even those with some physical limitations, can safely participate in a total of 40 minutes a week of this prescribed exercise program at home. The data also suggest some possible additional benefits of this exercise, including a decrease in the research participants\u2019 fasting glucose, cholesterol and glucose tolerance. The researchers are partnering with Wellstar Health System to expand and continue their research in finding practical and cost-effective ways to lower health risks in Type 2 diabetes patients. Wellstar Health System will help identify and evaluate participants and provide access to a broader pool that represents male, female and minority populations. \u201cWellstar is delighted to participate in this critical initiative to determine whether high-intensity circuit training is an appealing and effective exercise intervention for Type 2 diabetes,\u201d said Alencia Washington, assistant vice president of Research Administration at the Wellstar Research Institute. \u201cThe impressive grant score and feedback from the NIH on this research study further underscore the significance of this work. Evaluating, researching, and developing innovative treatment options and approaches to prevent and manage highly prevalent diseases is essential. Wellstar looks forward to the impactful insight this research will undoubtedly provide.\u201d During the 16-week research study, selected participants will be divided into two groups: those who will perform the high-intensity bodyweight circuit training exercises, such as modified squats, crunches and sit-ups, for 40 minutes each week; and those who will perform more traditional exercises, such as moderate aerobic activity, for 150 minutes each week. The grant will also cover the purchase of wearable devices that will track participants\u2019 physical activity. In addition to working with Wellstar Health System physicians, the KSU researchers will involve graduate and undergraduate students in assisting with the research process, including data collection such as measuring and recording body composition, taking blood samples for assessment, and downloading and documenting step counts from the wearable devices. Austin Brown, assistant professor of statistics, completes the team as the statistical consultant for the project. \u201cWe are very excited about Dr. Kliszczewicz\u2019s new NIH grant, which will support his impactful research to improve health and fitness among adults with diabetes,\u201d said Monica Swahn, dean of KSU\u2019s Wellstar College of Health and Human Services. \u201cWe need more interventions to mitigate the adverse health consequences among people with diabetes and that is exactly what this research is about. This is research with relevance.\u201d \u2013 Jacob Segura Related Stories Saint-Louis's undergraduate experience at Kennesaw State prepared him to return as faculty member Kennesaw State's Tyler Reinagel named to Atlanta Regional Commission leadership institute Kennesaw State researchers work to reduce threat of deadly disease to bats New grant supports Kennesaw State effort to expand course-based undergraduate research A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

As traffic rumbled overhead, they stopped under a crack in the concrete ceiling and shined the light, pausing at the sight of a few small, furry bodies seemingly stuck in the tight space. \u201cThere they are,\u201d Ferrari said, setting up the ladder. Ferrari climbed the ladder carefully, reached up into the crack and then gingerly extracted tricolored bats one by one with a gloved hand. She placed a bat into a protective sack and handed it to Upton, who noted each bat with a Sharpie marker on the outside of the bags. Steps away from the culvert with tools brought from the lab, they would weigh and measure each bat, take fur samples, evaluate the condition of their wings, and take a few other measurements as well. But their most important mission is to look at the bats\u2019 exposed skin, primarily their muzzles, feet and wings for any trace of a white substance that has proven deadly for these nocturnal creatures. A killer in the caves Pseudogymnoascus destructans is the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease that has killed tens of millions of bats in the past decade. The fungus takes hold while the bats hibernate during the winter, killing them slowly. \u201cThis is a continent-wide problem,\u201d Ferrari said. \u201cThis work is important, and it\u2019s amazing that our lab gets to be a part of finding a solution to this disease.\u201d Kennesaw State\u2019s BioInnovation Laboratory stands at the forefront of research into WNS. Headed up by associate professor Chris Cornelison and postdoctoral researcher Kyle Gabriel and housed within the College of Science and Mathematics, the scientists focus primarily on the fungus and employ both graduate and undergraduate students in their efforts. While the lab\u2019s portfolio also includes research into mushroom cultivation and additional emerging fungal pathogens, none of those has attracted the same level of attention and funding of the research into WNS, a problem Cornelison has described as \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d They have partnerships with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The DNR holds permits allowing the researchers to conduct surveys at multiple sites around the state under their guidance. Since founding the lab in 2017, Cornelison and Gabriel have received nearly three-quarters of a million dollars in funding for their work on WNS. The most recent is a $90,000 grant from the Bats for the Future Fund that will go toward the construction of an artificial hibernaculum in Rabun County, Ga., to simulate the caves and culverts where bats hibernate, in order to better investigate the efficacy of the treatment methods they\u2019ve developed to mitigate the deadly fungus. \u201cBats provide a number of ecological benefits. One of these is eating large amounts of insects, including many crop pests,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cThanks to bats, we can reduce the amount of toxic pesticides being applied to crops and the environment. Bats fill a unique niche and provide a significant economic and ecological benefit, not only to humans but also other wildlife.\u201d According to the University of Georgia Center for Agribusiness and Economic Development, agriculture is a $70 billion per year industry in the state. Additionally, a 2011 study published in Science Magazine estimated the value of bats to the U.S. agricultural industry to be between $3.7 billion and $5.3 billion per year, which accounts for the reduced cost of pesticides no longer needed due to the insects consumed by bats. A self-professed conservationist, Cornelison approaches the WNS problem from the viewpoint of conservation and acknowledging the importance of all species. Bats have inherent value to the ecosystem, he said. Kyle Gabriel and Chris Cornelison \u201cOrganisms have value based on biodiversity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that they exist alone presents value worth maintaining those populations. Biodiversity is the most precious commodity on the planet. If there is a way that we can reduce human-mediated species loss with our expertise, it is incumbent upon us to do that. That\u2019s my personal ethos.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s expertise takes in many aspects of science, including engineering and invention, as evidenced by the building of the artificial hibernaculum. Cornelison and Gabriel developed chemical formulations to kill the fungus in the environment and on the bats while they hibernate. The formulation combines two commercially available liquids \u2014 B23 and decanal \u2014 that demonstrate significant inhibition of the WNS fungus while having low toxicity to mammals. Gabriel modified an industrial aerosolizer that can autonomously spray an extremely fine mist of the formulation in the hibernaculum without disturbing the bats. The aerosolizer is pulled \u2014 slowly \u2014 into the hibernaculum by an electric winch and pulley system attached to a small boat. Cornelison\u2019s lifelong love for wildlife led to his interest in bats, and his doctoral project helped him learn about the importance of bats to the ecosystem. He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the fungus that causes WNS and shortly thereafter received his first grant. He also worked as a postdoctoral researcher with the U.S. Forest Service, focusing on the mitigation of WNS. That doesn\u2019t make his job any easier, however. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to work in conservation biology because everything is dying and things we try to save species sometimes don\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know why it matters, which makes me even more cognizant to it not working, so I focus even harder on finding solutions.\u201d Promising signs Gabriel said the data indicate their efforts might be working. From 2017 to 2022, the bat population at Black Diamond Tunnel in north Georgia roughly doubled to a population of 362 at the latest count in January. As with any aspect of science, the process is ongoing and will take years to claim success. Cornelison credits the efforts of his fellow researchers at Georgia DNR and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and undergraduate and graduate students from throughout the College of Science and Mathematics, with advancing the study and providing a constant flow of new energy and perspectives toward solving the problem. Both Ferrari and Upton are in the Masters of Science in Integrative Biology program with theses focused on bat research. Ferrari\u2019s thesis involves how various types of bat hibernacula affect susceptibility to WNS, while Upton\u2019s thesis involves research into the microbiomes found on bat wings. Upton presented at the National Council on Undergraduate Research hosted by KSU in 2018, where she met Cornelison for the first time and, after discussing her project and learning about the BioInnovation Lab, realized that she belonged in the lab and at Kennesaw State. \u201cI had mostly done genetic barcoding and population genetics work before, but I was slowly getting more excited by wildlife diseases,\u201d Upton said. \u201cSince the BioInnovation Lab had projects dedicated to studying white-nose syndrome, I figured it was a good fit and came to study under Dr. Cornelison. I never aimed to study bats for a career, but this is where research has taken me and I love it.\u201d At the culvert last fall, Ferrari and Upton worked with four researchers from Georgia DNR. That day, they processed 15 bats, finding no evidence of WNS. Both Ferrari and Upton held the tiny, flying mammals in their hands, examining them one last time before letting each go. Almost immediately, the bats flew back into the culvert, where they would spend the winter hibernating. \u2013 Dave Shelles Photos by Jason Getz Related Stories Kennesaw State honors student researchers in annual Birla Carbon Scholars Symposium Kennesaw State researcher receives grant to study pollution effects in birds Kennesaw State adding program to diversify biomedical sciences A trio of Kennesaw State students spreads the gospel of ecology and conservation through engaging social media content A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

Amy Buddie Kennesaw State University Director of Undergraduate Research and Professor of Psychology Amy Buddie said redesigning courses to include research opportunities allows STEM students to focus and engage more with projects and ultimately better prepare them for the future. \u201cYou don\u2019t get this kind of hands-on research experience in a traditional classroom setting,\u201d she said. \u201cIn redesigned courses, you\u2019re better preparing students to think critically, solve problems, and speak publicly about their original findings, which employers and professors alike value heavily.\u201d The grant will support Buddie\u2019s research project on working with various university organizations to integrate Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs ) into Kennesaw State\u2019s STEM courses. The grant is part of the NSF\u2019s Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) program , a highly selective initiative with only a set amount of available funds to disperse annually. \u201cThis grant can catalyze those of us in STEM education to have the conversations we\u2019ve avoided for too long,\u201d Buddie said. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance for us to work collaboratively and give our students real opportunities from inside the classroom.\u201d Buddie credits Office of Research leaders Phaedra Corso, Evelina Sterling, and Amanda DesLauriers for their continued support and assistance with the project. \u2013 Renee Hudson Related Stories Saint-Louis's undergraduate experience at Kennesaw State prepared him to return as faculty member Kennesaw State's Tyler Reinagel named to Atlanta Regional Commission leadership institute Kennesaw State researchers work to reduce threat of deadly disease to bats Kennesaw State professor finds purpose, inspiration in collaboration A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

Thomas McElroy \u201cI just mostly like the people I work with,\u201d McElroy said. \u201cI\u2019m excited for them about what they\u2019re excited about, and if I can help them and they can help me, then great. Let\u2019s get to work.\u201d Over his 18 years at Kennesaw State, McElroy, an associate professor of biology who studies genetic variations in various populations, has been a go-to resource and valuable partner for faculty members throughout the College of Science and Mathematics and beyond. One of the reasons he came to work at KSU was the opportunity for collaboration with fellow faculty members. In one such collaboration, associate professor of biology Eric Albrecht needed help to figure out why venom in adult and juvenile scorpions has different levels of toxicity, so he turned to McElroy, as have more than 20 researchers before him. In Albrecht\u2019s case, he and McElroy pooled their resources in terms of funding, student assistants and laboratory processes for a published paper. \u201cDNA and RNA are everywhere,\u201d McElroy said. \u201cI can study seagrasses, scorpions, snakes, soil, and find variable genetic markers. A lot of people have different expertise, and this helps them expand their research projects to incorporate another level of questions, this time on a genetic level.\u201d Albrecht said he sought out McElroy\u2019s expertise on ecological genetics for that reason \u2013 to take the acquired knowledge to a deeper level. McElroy also helped secure internal funding, guide student work on the study and write the manuscript that ultimately was published. Albrecht and McElroy stressed the importance of collaborations resulting from everyday encounters. \u201cMost internal collaborations develop through conversation and similar research interests, and often one faculty member pursues a partnership with another,\u201d Albrecht said. \u201cIn all collaborations, the faculty have to work at the same pace, have the same goals, have critical expertise and get along personally. That\u2019s why I chose to work with Thom.\u201d That\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work for McElroy. He has helped with research into white-nose syndrome among bats, how urbanization affects stream water quality, and how switchgrass can help mitigate lead-poisoned soil. He even collaborated with the theater department on a series of short plays about de-extinction and the origins of Bigfoot. In addition to working with a wide range of faculty members, McElroy said he enjoys the teaching aspect of his job as well \u2014 another type of collaboration. He has mentored scores of students in both undergraduate and graduate research, which he says is the most satisfying aspect of his job. An avid musician, McElroy said he sees teaching as its own kind of performance and tries to convey that enthusiasm to his students, whether guiding their lab work or speaking on the day\u2019s topic. \u201cEncouraging students to be curious and want to learn is a big part of my job. This is where scientists come from, so I hope I can help them be enthusiastic about science,\u201d McElroy said. \u201cBecause their success is our success, and that\u2019s very important to me.\u201d \u2013 Dave Shelles Photos by David Caselli Related Stories Kennesaw State honors student researchers in annual Birla Carbon Scholars Symposium Kennesaw State researcher receives grant to study pollution effects in birds Kennesaw State adding program to diversify biomedical sciences A trio of Kennesaw State students spreads the gospel of ecology and conservation through engaging social media content A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

Research shows that CUREs are effective in many different disciplines and for students at all levels , including the first year. As one scholar notes , \"Undergraduate demand for research positions far exceeds supply;\" CUREs can help provide a solution to this problem. Undergraduate research is a high-impact practice for students, and KSU is committed to supporting students in research through the \"It's About Engagement\" initiative. The purpose of this Course Redesign Institute is to help faculty design or redesign courses so that they are aligned with the definitions and guidelines for the \"It's About Engagement\" initiative. Faculty in this Institute will participate in an intensive, week-long experience where they will learn about designing CUREs. Time will be provided for participants to create or re-create a syllabus for a course they are planning to teach over the next year. Faculty accepted to this Institute will be paid a stipend of $1,500 upon completion of the requirements. Below are some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the Undergraduate Research Course Redesign Institute. If you have any other questions, please contact our@kennesaw.edu . What topics will be covered in this Institute? At the end of this Institute, participants will be able to: Describe best practices in course design and apply those practices to a course they will teach over the next year. Describe the \"It's About Engagement\" initiative at KSU. Summarize the literature on CUREs (Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences), including benefits and best practices in structuring them. Create a syllabus for a course they will teach over the next year that incorporates an undergraduate research experience that can be disseminated outside of the class. Develop an assignment for reflection on the undergraduate research experience, consistent with guidelines for the \"It's About Engagement\" initiative. On the final day, participants share their newly (re)designed artifacts. These artifacts may include a syllabus, course activities, assessments, and/or rubrics. When is the next offering? The Institute will be 9:00am - 5:00pm each day with the last day (Friday) as a half-day. The Institute will be held the week of May 23, 2022. What is the stipend amount for participating in this institute? Each accepted faculty member will receive $1,500 for their participation in this Institute as long as the requirements are met Who is eligible to participate in this Institute? All full-time faculty, part-time faculty, and lecturers who are under contract to teach during the semester the course will be delivered are eligible to apply. How do I apply?

This is the second post in a series on the research conducted in this area. Abstract The primary goal of this research is to investigate the possibilities of utilizing audio feedback to support effective Human-Computer Interaction Virtual Environments (VEs) without visual feedback for people with Visual Impairments. Efforts have been made to apply virtual reality (VR) technology for training and educational applications for diverse population groups, such as children and stroke patients. Those applications had already shown effects of increasing motivations, providing safer training environments and more training opportunities. However, they are all based on visual feedback. With the head related transfer functions (HRTFs), it is possible to design and develop considerably safer, but diversified training environments that might greatly benefit individuals with VI. In order to explore this, I ran three studies sequentially: 1) if/how users could navigate themselves with different types of 3D auditory feedback in the same VE; 2) if users could recognize the distance and direction of a virtual sound source in the virtual environment (VE) effectively; 3) if users could recognize the positions and distinguish the moving directions of 3D sound sources in the VE between the participants with and without VI. The results showed some possibilities of designing effective Human-Computer Interaction methods and some understandings of how the participants with VI experienced the scenarios differently than the participants without VI. Therefore, this research contributed new knowledge on how a visually impaired person interacts with computer interfaces, which can be used to derive guidelines for the design of effective VEs for rehabilitation and exercise.

This is the first post in a series on the research conducted in this area. Virtual Reality (VR) technologies are able to create rich, interactive worlds for users. Many popular applications use immersive 3D graphics to convey information about a person\u2019s surroundings and how they should move through it. However, this approach is not sufficient for the estimated 285 million people with visual impairments, who rely on their other senses in their day to day life. We believe that VR programs can also construct these explorable virtual environments through digital versions of other sensory feedback, such as voice or vibrations. The goal of our study is to answer the question: Can computer-generated versions of real world auditory and tactile feedback provide useful navigation information to individuals with visual impairments? Experiment For this study, we examined two main aspects of movement \u2013 deciding which direction to face, and determining the distance to your destination. Individuals with reduced vision capabilities often utilize ambient noise, vibrations, and feedback from tools such as walking canes to help them perform these two tasks as they navigate from place to place. Our intent was to determine if artificial versions of these stimuli could be effectively utilized in the same way as the physical versions. Our test trials took place at the Georgia Institute of Technology campus in Atlanta, GA. Sixteen participants with visual impairments were selected to take part in the study. After being fitted with an HTC Vive headset, each individual went through seven different trials, consisting of the following conditions: Direction Detection with Virtual Audio (DDVA) Direction Detection with Virtual Audio and Haptics (DDVAH) Direction Detection with Real Audio (DDRA) Direction Detection with Real Audio and Haptics (DDRAH) Navigation with Virtual Audio (NVA) Navigation with Virtual Audio and Speech Reinforcement (NVASR) Navigation with Real Audio (NRA) During the Direction Detection tests, a tonal sound source (either in the virtual environment or in the real world) was randomly placed around the participant. They were then asked to turn in place until they felt they were facing the origin of the sound. Once they confirmed this, the difference between their direction and that of the sound source was recorded, and the sound was moved to a new location. The Navigation tests expanded on this by requiring the user to actually walk to where they believed the sound was emanating from. Again, after the participant confirmed they believed they had reached the sound\u2019s origin, the actual remaining distance was recorded and the audio source was moved to another location (either physically or virtually). Results We compared the trial results using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test . In addition to the previously stated metrics for the Direction Detection and Navigation trials, we also measured the time taken to complete each task. Since moving from place to place must be done in a timely manner as well as correctly, we felt this was a valuable feature to study. Initially, participants performed their tasks more quickly when relying on real world audio. However, as they repeated the trials, the difference in completion time between real and virtual audio shrank. During the final tests of a session, the participant completion speed between virtual and real audio cues was distinguishable only when the virtual cues was not reinforcement by kinetic signals. The addition of haptic feedback to auditory direction guidance was shown to improve participant\u2019s speed and effectiveness. This finding was illustrated in the quantitative results and further confirmed by commentary for the participants themselves, who reported that they felt more confident when they could rely on vibrations as well as audio for navigation. In contrast, participants took longer to complete the Navigation with Virtual Audio scenarios when speech reinforcement was added in. We speculate that the added complexity of interpreting verbal commands compared to simple vibrations led to the increase in completion time. Conclusion We believe the results of our study show the viability of non-visual navigation guidance techniques in virtual spaces. While the participants generally made faster movement decisions when guided by real audio, they were ultimately able to navigate in a comparably effective manner using virtual sound instructions. Participant\u2019s ability to navigate was further improved by reinforcing auditory cues with kinetic ones. We feel these findings are encouraging for current and future portable VR applications for individuals with visual impairments, as useful navigation information could be generated through digital accessories rather relying on in-place, physical sources.

Melanie Griffin and Martin Hudson Professor of biology Martin Hudson and associate professor of biology Melanie Griffin in the College of Science and Mathematics received a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to establish the Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) at Kennesaw State. The five-year grant is for $1,238,980. \u201cThis award recognizes exemplary leadership by Drs. Martin Hudson and Melanie Griffin in helping our college provide students the outstanding training in sciences that makes them highly sought after in the biomedical workforce,\u201d said Kojo Mensa-Wilmot, dean of the College of Science and Mathematics. As part of U-RISE, researchers will focus on recruiting undergraduate students from underrepresented student populations, often first-generation college students and women. \u201cIt is important for the biomedical sciences to better reflect the world at large, and that means a more diverse field of researchers,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThis is an opportunity for KSU to stand at the forefront of providing research opportunities for the biomedical scientists of the future.\u201d In 2010, the U.S. Census showed that Hispanic, Black and Indigenous Americans were 30% of the population, but just 9% of students in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)-related doctoral programs. \u201cBringing U-RISE to campus is an effort to address the disparity in the number of students from underrepresented populations that end up with Ph.D.s and M.D./Ph.D.s, starting at the undergraduate level,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe\u2019re recruiting good students, getting them lab training and then guiding them into being clever young scientists. In turn, those people can be role models in attracting others to follow in their steps.\u201d Griffin said KSU\u2019s Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry will support the program by providing participants with faculty mentors and laboratory experience. Most biomedical Ph.D. programs attract students from those disciplines, though students from other majors would be welcomed into U-RISE. The U-RISE implementation began in April and already the first cohort of U-RISE students has spent part of the summer gaining laboratory experience. U-RISE joins other diversity efforts in the sciences at Kennesaw State. The University also supports the Peach State Bridges to the Doctorate program, in which scholars pursue a master\u2019s degree in integrative biology or chemical sciences. Hudson has brought undergraduate science majors into his lab under those auspices and was eager to collaborate with Griffin in bringing the U-RISE program to KSU. Griffin also directs the Kennesaw campus group of the NSF-funded Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program, which provides research and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate STEM students from underrepresented communities. \u2014 Dave Shelles Photos by Matt Yung Related Stories Kennesaw State honors student researchers in annual Birla Carbon Scholars Symposium Kennesaw State researcher receives grant to study pollution effects in birds A trio of Kennesaw State students spreads the gospel of ecology and conservation through engaging social media content Saint-Louis's undergraduate experience at Kennesaw State prepared him to return as faculty member A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

The possibility of triggering stronger and more specific emotional reactions in a safer environment arises the interest to use VR as a therapeutic intervention for individuals with mental disorders, yet the use of VR in diagnosis has still not been fully investigated. The main purpose of this project is to create a Dynamic Affective Virtual Environment Gaming (DaveG) that can assist depression diagnosis. Specifically, DaveG would assess user emotions by concurrent psychophysiological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and real-time feedback. It uses different themes, that elicit positive/neutral/negative feelings, to evaluate the emotional reactions. The results of the data analysis will lead to an innovative method of depression detection as a supplementary method to the traditional approaches of diagnosis. Most of the present experiments focus on using VR in exposure therapy that measures the improvement between pre-test and post-test, especially for anxiety disorders. The proposed system is a creative VR-based real-time biofeedback system with self-adaptation to user emotional reactions, which is specifically designed to be used in early depression screening. In future studies, more advanced data analysis methods will be performed to build customized models and serve as the guidance for VR intervention sessions for depression. It also has the potential to be extended to apply to other mental health disorders.

(Oct 9, 2018) \u2014 Much like Google Maps collects information from motorists to plot out roadways, Kennesaw State University students are using data from smartphones to more efficiently map indoor spaces. The research, conducted by Kennesaw State students Nick Murphy, Devan Patel, Drew Savas and Derek Martin, sought applications for a self-updating virtual map that could guide users through a space that experiences frequent changes to its layout, such as a museum or grocery store. Currently, developers must painstakingly take manual measurements of an interior before creating it virtually, which is problematic because it must be rebuilt each time the environment changes. The students hope the approach can be used on commercial applications as well as helping the visually impaired avoid obstacles in high-traffic areas.

This is the fourth post in a series on the research conducted in this area. A common training approach to assist persons with visual impairments to gain autonomous mobility in unfamiliar locations is for a professional mobility trainer to repeatedly walk a path with them until they memorize the path. However, these repetitive training sessions are time-consuming and may need to be restarted if environmental conditions change, such as additional furniture in the space or remodeled rooms. This paper explores the feasibility of using generalized Virtual Reality technology (conveyed by auditory feedback) to assist users with real-time navigation and route recall. Using an experimental system, participants navigated both purely virtual and mixed reality locations during initial testing with a follow-up session to study path retention. Metrics collected on user performance and confidence during the sessions suggest the potential of virtual reality based guidance systems for aiding individuals with visual impairments.

This is the third post in a series on the research conducted in this area. Virtual and Augmented Reality applications need a detailed model of the surrounding environment as well as their own location within it to provide users with immersive, interactive experiences. However, current techniques to build such models are often time-consuming, and require manual correction as the area they represent changes and evolves. As the model of the environment is often completed before the application put into use, it is unable to benefit from new information detected by the location\u2019s tracking sensors. This paper proposes a solution that utilizes aggregate position data from an area to develop that space\u2019s walkable mesh model. Participant locations were measured from Bluetooth Low Energy beacons via mobile devices, and that data set was then grouped together and filtered to produce an estimation of the total environment in the form of a two dimensional navigation mesh. The experiments produced several meshes that conformed to the walkable pathways of distinct layouts in an academic building.

The basic idea is to let autistic children play serious games that dynamically adapt to their emotions while their emotional reactions are recorded by several devices, and their emotions are analyzed by physiological signals. The adaptive system provides evaluation for serious game-based therapy sessions, as well as the potential directions for further treatment. An affective game framework that targets the intervention of autism will be developed, using the most advanced VR tools but not limited to VR. This framework is a new approach that integrates different layers of emotion analyzers such as behavioral analysis including audio emotion detection, facial emotion detection, and textual emotion detection, as well as physiological signal emotion analysis. With fusion and integration, the game will be able to provide feedback to the current emotional status. Pilot data from experiments show significant differences in emotional re-activities between the autistic groups and the control group, which proved the assumption that serious games could be used in intervention or therapy for the autistic group, especially targeting their emotional competence. This research is looking to seek an NIH grant for 2020.

The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United State has grown significantly in recent years, and while there have been some successful efforts to address this issue by exploiting VR-based therapies, most of them merely use VR as an alternative way to simulate existing approaches. An important feature of VR technology \u2013 the ability to generate \u201cimpossible experiences\u201d (i.e., experiences that cannot be created in the real world, such as a chair disappearing upon the user\u2019s gaze) \u2013 seems to be missing in these systems, because this feature was not available when most traditional ASD therapies were developed. The envisaged system will employ specifically designed \u201cimpossible experiences\u201d to deliver an individualized therapy that addresses the attention deficits of children with ASD. The research will improve the learning ability for children with ASD and provide novel design guidelines for future VR systems used in ASD therapy. The PI will study research questions and develop the system incrementally. The overall logic of the system is: 1) Expose the user to a virtual environment to finish a task (e.g., listen to a virtual teacher talking); 2) Detect the user\u2019s attention with eye-tracking data and physiological signals, then remove all the detected distractions (e.g., a red mug) from the virtual environment; 3) Gradually restore all distractions into the virtual environment, expose the user to one more distraction object at a time and reinforce the correct attention. To implement this strategy, the PI will first explore attention capture in VR and strategies for reinforcement in VR through short user studies. Then, the effectiveness of the entire system will be evaluated through a six-month long, multiple-baseline design across participants study. All the studies will be conducted with K-12 students with medium to high levels of ASD. This award reflects NSF\u2019s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation\u2019s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
